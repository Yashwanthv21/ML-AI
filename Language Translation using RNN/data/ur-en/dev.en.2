According to Quran's Chapter 35 (Al-faatir) Verse 24, apart from the 25 prophets and messengers mentioned in Quran, in accordance to Islamic faith, there are many prophets whose names are not mentioned in Quran. In light of this verse, prophet(s) were sent every community. A well-accepted hadees in this regard quoted by Imam Ahmed-bin-Hambal and Fatah-Albaari in Sahih Bukhari which notes the number of prophets as 124000. Evidently, this might include those personalities from other religions, who are  thought to be either the founders of or the God in that religion. For example, Sidharth Gautam, the founder of Budhism and other such religion founders.

Although this thought is widely accepted by Sunni and Shias and even by the Buddhists, since "Gautam Budhha" is not named explicitly in Quran most scholars refrain from endorsing this thought.
