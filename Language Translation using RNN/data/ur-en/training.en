Like the 'Oneness of Spirit', Esotericism and Atheism (it is possible that Atheism was taken as Paganism or denial of god in that Fatwa), this belief also exists that after achieving some milestones, a time may come when a human being could even become immune to following Islam. According to Irshad al Maluk (by Maulana  Aashiq al Marathi), one of the terms of receiving guidance is to receive by the Sheikh, just as the Saha'abas received their guidance from Prophet of Allah (P.B.U.H).
Later sufiat (Normally change the replacement ) many biddats and mubalgat are included and philosphy many view has make there place in which
Later, many unwanted changes and overtures got into the definition of sufism and many philosophical thought found a place under sufism such as one-ness, esotericism, atheism (in this fatwa, it may have refered to seconding or denial), After which, a person might also think that he need not follow islam anymore. Accordint to Irshad-ul-malook (Maulana Aashiq Ilahi Marathi), one of the conditions for Zikr (invocation) was to get it from the Shaik exactly as it Sahaaba used to get their Zikr from the Prophet (PBUH).

Against, the historian’s who were mystic and concerned about Theosophy and philosophy (For Example Rene Guenon al ma’aroof Abdul Wahed Yahya (1886 to 1951)) this word Sophos instead of Sufi is main word in Numerology and takes its support. And according to him the present number of numerology is equal to the intelligence so the word is equal to Sophia.

This ideology of Sufism being lexically a part of Quran cannot be said to be very much different from hidden nature of conversance. Sufis also believe in the difference of Islam in between visible and invisible which means the regular recitation of Quran and searching for those implicit meanings which are invisible or hidden inside is the basis of Sufism according to Sufis
Lexically, the meaning of "tasawwuf" in view of Quran is to insert or to include, is not much different from hidden side of the book. Most sufis also prefer to divide Islam on the basis of this hidden and openness, meaning constant recitation of quran and searching the hidden meaning which are not visible in open. For most sufis, this forms the base of sufism

In the Quran Sufism is lexically which is different from the words.

For example, it has been determined by the artifacts including sewing fabric, cultivation of rice, Shaman rituals and iron and bronze tools dug out through the archaeological digging about the Yayuae period (approximately 300 BC-250 AD), that this art has reached here through Chinese and Korean people. In fact, there is evidence that rice cultivation had started in 8000 BC (approximately?) in the surrounding regions of the famous Chinese river Yangtze, and reached the land of Japan in 1000 BC (approximately?).
For example year 250 to 300, Archeological survey's says that there was textile business crafts, Iron, Nickel etc.
For examples the artifacts from the 300 BC to 250 AD, which include clothe stiching, metal, bronze etc tell us that this came from the Chinese and Korean people. There is also proof that rice was sown around the Chinese river Yangzhi since 8000 BC and it reached Japan in 1000 BC
For example from 300 BC to 250 AD the signs found from ancient decades, cloth weaving, the cropping of paddy, great beliefs of worship, iron and bronze found from the period of Yayeevay has shown that this art has passed from Chinese and Koreans into Japan instead there are proofs of the fact that the cultivation of rice started in the nearby areas of the Yongus river in 8000 BC and reached to the land of Japanese in 1000 BC.

An optical fiber is a thin, flexible, transparent fiber that acts as a waveguide, or "light pipe", to transmit light between the two ends of the fiber. The field of applied science and engineering concerned with the design and application of optical fibers is known as fiber optics. Optical fibers are widely used in fiber-optic communications.
Due to this reason, network packets easily travel in both the wired networks - such as copper wires, coaxial cables and optical fibers etc - and wireless networks - such as Wi-Fi etc - because all of the networks collectively follow the only one protocol of a network.

Normally, a simple mathematical procedure could be easily solved with the help of a calculator, but if the mathematical procedure involves large number of digits, then it requires a lot of time in order to solved by the calculator. For example, if a problem involves the addition of all the digits between 1 and 1000, then the calculator's buttons would have to be pressed more than 1000 times and more time would be required. But if a computer is provided with instructions to analyze this procedure only once, then it will store them inside itself and would be able to execute this mathematical procedure by utilizing these instructions the next time around, which would only take a few moments.
In General to make easy the calculation we use the calculator like wise to make easy the documentation sending the messages, saving the orders etc, can be done in computer.
Generally, if any simple calculation is needed, it can be easily done by the calculator , but if the calculation is related to long figures then if it is done by conventional method or by arithmetic then much more extra time is required , for example if summation of all the numbers between 1 and 1000 is needed then nearly one thousand times the button of addition is to be pressed, and time needed to do this will also be more but if the computer is instructed to do the task then it will store it inside its memory and for next time it will use it and can perform the arithmetic operation in few seconds only.
normally if there is some simple problem it can be done by calculator but if it is mathematical problem the it has to be done in some particular way so that requires more time, for example you have to add from 1 to 1000 then you have to press all buttons and more time is require but if you give all these instruction to the shumarinda one time so from next time it will do it self automatically which requires only seconds
