During 17th century, many references of cricket popularity in East England. This became prestigious event later. It is said that after restoration of 1660, professionals were came in front. In 1697, this game played at very high bet in sussex which itself a "Big Cricket Match" where 11 players played, this report was published in newspaper. This was a first news of such kind.
During the 17th century, numerous references indicate the growth of cricket in the south-east of England. By the end of the century, it had become an organised activity being played for high stakes and it is believed that the first professionals appeared in the years following the Restoration in 1660. A newspaper report survives of "a great cricket match" with eleven players a side that was played for high stakes in Sussex in 1697 and this is the earliest known reference to a cricket match of such importance.
Gambling introduced the first patrons because some of the gamblers decided to strengthen their bets by forming their own teams and it is believed the first "county teams" were formed in the aftermath of the Restoration in 1660, especially as members of the nobility were employing "local experts" from village cricket as the earliest professionals.[5] The first known game in which the teams use county names is in 1709 but there can be little doubt that these sort of fixtures were being arranged long before that. The match in 1697 was probably Sussex versus another county.    The most notable of the early patrons were a group of aristocrats and businessmen who were active from about 1725, which is the time that press coverage became more regular, perhaps as a result of the patrons' influence. These men included the 2nd Duke of Richmond, Sir William Gage, Alan Brodrick and Edward Stead. For the first time, the press mentions individual players like Thomas Waymark.
Cricket certainly thrived after the Restoration in 1660 and is believed to have first attracted gamblers making large bets at this time. In 1664, the "Cavalier" Parliament passed the Gaming Act 1664 which limited stakes to £100, although that was still a fortune at the time,[1] equivalent to about £12 thousand in present day terms [7]. Cricket had certainly become a significant gambling sport by the end of the 17th century. There is a newspaper report of a "great match" played in Sussex in 1697 which was 11-a-side and played for high stakes of 50 guineas a side.[6]    With freedom of the press having been granted in 1696, cricket for the first time could be reported in the newspapers. But it was a long time before the newspaper industry adapted sufficiently to provide frequent, let alone comprehensive, coverage of the game. During the first half of the 18th century, press reports tended to focus on the betting rather than on the play

On 17 February 2009, GSM association announced that they agreed on a standard charer for the mobile phone. 17 manufacturers, includiing Nokia, Samsung and Motorola. The standard charger to be used by them has to be micro USB linkable (nany media reports said this as mini-USB by mistake).  New chargers will be more suitable than existing chargers.  The implication of all phones having a standard charger is that manufacturers need not supply a new charger with every new phone.

On 28 December 2009 German computer engineer Karsten Nohl announced that he had cracked the A5/1 cipher.[14] According to Nohl, he developed a number of rainbow tables (static values which reduce the time needed to carry out an attack) and have found new sources for known plaintext attacks. He also said that it is possible to build "a full GSM interceptor ... from open source components" but that they had not done so because of legal concerns.[15]    In 2010, threatpost.com reported that "A group of cryptographers has developed a new attack that has broken Kasumi, the encryption algorithm used to secure traffic on 3G GSM wireless networks. The technique enables them to recover a full key by using a tactic known as a related-key attack, but experts say it is not the end of the world for Kasumi."[16] Kasumi is the name for the A5/3 algorithm, used to secure most 3G traffic.
The SMS concept was developed in the Franco-German GSM cooperation in 1984 by Friedhelm Hillebrand and Bernard Ghillebaert.[6] The innovation in SMS is Short. The GSM is optimized for telephony, since this was identified as its main application. The key idea for SMS was to use this telephony-optimized system, and to transport messages on the signaling paths needed to control the telephony traffic during time periods when no signaling traffic existed. In this way, unused resources in the system could be used to transport messages at minimal cost. However, it was necessary to limit the length of the messages to 128 bytes (later improved to 140 bytes, or 160 seven-bit characters) so that the messages could fit into the existing signaling formats.    This concept allowed SMS to be implemented in every mobile station by updating its software. This concept was instrumental for the implementation of SMS in every mobile station ever produced and in every network from early days. Hence, a large base of SMS capable terminals and networks existed when the users began to utilize the SMS.[7] A new network element required was a specialized short message service center, and enhancements were required to the radio capacity and network transport infrastructure to accommodate growing SMS traffic.

Often, several instruments are combined in an instrument mix formulated to address a certain environmental problem. Since environmental issues often have many different aspects, several policy instruments may be needed to adequately address each one. Furthermore, instrument mixes may allow firms greater flexibility in finding ways to comply with government policy while reducing the uncertainty in the cost of doing so. However, instrument mixes must be carefully formulated so that the individual measures within them do not undermine each other or create a rigid and cost-ineffective compliance framework. Also, overlapping instruments lead to unnecessary administrative costs, making implementation of environmental policies more costly than necessary.In order to help governments realize their environmental policy goals, the OECD Environment Directorate studies and collects data on the efficiency of the environmental instruments governments use to achieve their goals as well as their consequences for other policies.

Such cases are considered illegal in which the controlled level of effluent is very high or law is ignored willfully. In many cases from pollution dilution to elimination during halt, has to face economic challenges and technical hurdels.

  During the earlier Middle Ages, before the European Dark Ages, was a period of blessing to the environment. Industrial activity slowed down, population growth was not fast. Towards the end of the Middle Ages, population grew and got concentrated in cities, this gave a thrust to direct pollution. In particular places, level of air pollution was harmful to health, and in populated centres, water pollution was a serious medium for spread of diseases from untreated human waste.
Water pollution is a major problem in the global context. It has been suggested that it is the leading worldwide cause of deaths and diseases,[1][2] and that it accounts for the deaths of more than 14,000 people daily.[2] An estimated 700 million Indians have no access to a proper toilet, and 1,000 Indian children die of diarrheal sickness every day.[3] Some 90% of China's cities suffer from some degree of water pollution,[4] and nearly 500 million people lack access to safe drinking water.[5] In addition to the acute problems of water pollution in developing countries, industrialized countries continue to struggle with pollution problems as well. In the most recent national report on water quality in the United States, 45 percent of assessed stream miles, 47 percent of assessed lake acres, and 32 percent of assessed bay and estuarine square miles were classified as polluted.[6]    Water is typically referred to as polluted when it is impaired by anthropogenic contaminants and either does not support a human use, like serving as drinking water, and/or undergoes a marked shift in its ability to support its constituent biotic communities, such as fish. Natural phenomena such as volcanoes, algae blooms, storms, and earthquakes also cause major changes in water quality and the ecological status of water.

In the most recent national report on water quality in the United States, 45 percent of assessed stream miles, 47 percent of assessed lake acres, and 32 percent of assessed bay and estuarine square miles were classified as polluted.[6]    Water is typically referred to as polluted when it is impaired by anthropogenic contaminants and either does not support a human use, like serving as drinking water, and/or undergoes a marked shift in its ability to support its constituent biotic communities, such as fish. Natural phenomena such as volcanoes, algae blooms, storms, and earthquakes also cause major changes in water quality and the ecological status of water.
It is a great bloom for dark ages middle ages for climate ,in that birth rates are not increased in middle age it increases and located mostly in cities and it is a dangerous age water pollution and human wastes cost diseases.

The Indian state of Punjab was created in 1947, when the Partition of India split the former Raj province of Punjab between India and Pakistan. The mostly Muslim western part of the province became Pakistan's Punjab Province; the mostly Sikh and Hindu eastern part became India's Punjab state. Many Hindus and Sikhs lived in the west, and many Muslims lived in the east, and so the partition saw many people displaced and much intercommunal violence.    Lahore and Amritsar were at the center of the problem, the British were not sure where to place them - make them part of India or Pakistan. The British decided to give Lahore to Pakistan, whilst Amritsar became part of India. Areas in west Punjab such as Lahore, Rawalpindi, Multan, Gujart, had a large Sikh population and many of the residents were attacked or killed by radical Muslims.[citation needed] On the other side in East Punjab cities such as Amritsar, Ludhiana, and Gurdaspur had a majority Muslim population in which many of them were wiped out by Sikh guerrillas who launched an all out war against the Muslims.

Many times the words "terrorist" and "extremism" used interchangeably.but they are different in between this two words  terrorism means danger or physical violence. Extremism means physical political uses .
Many times the words like " terrorism" and "extremism" are interchangeably used .However, there is a major difference between the two. Terrorism
Over the years, many people have attempted to come up with a terrorist profile to attempt to explain these individuals' actions through their psychology and social circumstances. Others, like Roderick Hindery, have sought to discern profiles in the propaganda tactics used by terrorists. Some security organizations designate these groups as violent non-state actors.[87] A 2007 study by economist Alan B. Krueger found that terrorists were less likely to come from an impoverished background (28% vs. 33%) and more likely to have at least a high-school education (47% vs. 38%). Another analysis found only 16% of terrorists came from impoverished families, vs. 30% of male Palestinians, and over 60% had gone beyond high school, vs. 15% of the populace.[88]    To avoid detection, a terrorist will look, dress, and behave normally until executing the assigned mission. Some claim that attempts to profile terrorists based on personality, physical, or sociological traits are not useful.[89] The physical and behavioral description of the terrorist could describe almost any normal person.[90] However, the majority of terrorist attacks are carried out by military age men, aged 16–40
Terrorist are also calles as extremist but they have thier own differnt working style. Examples - irani revolution in 1979

In the West there is misconception about the meaning of the word Mahtama. According to them it is Sanskrit word meaning noble for mahan and soul for atma. In most of the writings like that of Dutta and Robinson’s ‘Rabindranath Tagore’, it is stated in the compilation that it was Rabindranath Tagore who first gave the title ‘mahatma’, according some other writings it was Nautamlal Bhagavanji Mehta on 21 January1915 gave this title to him. Though Gandhi in his auto biography stated that at no point of time ever felt he deserved the title, according to citation Gandhi for his belief on truth and justice and commendable unmatched sacrifice was given the title.
Generally the word Mahatma is misunderstood in western countries. This word comes from a sanskrit word. Maha means great whereas atma means soul.According to Dutta and Robinson, the title of Mahatma was given to Gandhiji by Rabindranath Tagore. Other sources claim that this titile was bestowed upon him by Nautamlal Bhagavanji Mehta on 21st January 1915. In his autobiography Gandhiji states that he is not worthy of this title.But it is true that he is said to be a mahatma for his pursuit of justice and non violence.
In the west the word Mahatma is often used in the wrong meaning, according to them this has been taken from Sanskrit in which Maha means great and atma means soul.As per majority of sources like Dutta and Robinsons RabindraNath Tagore: collections, it is said that Rabindranath Tagore was the first to give the title of Mahatma to Gandhi. As per other sources Nautamlal Bhagavanji Mehta on 21 January 1915 gave him the title, even though Gandhi has told on his autobiography that he never felt that he was suitable for this title.As per book, Gandhi got the title of Mahatma for this commendable sacrifices for justice and truth.
In the western countries the meaning of Mahatma is not assumed in the right sense. They think  this word came from Sanskrit in which the meaning of Maha is great and Atma means soul.According to theories  and Robinson this name for the first time is pronounced by Ravindra Nath Tagore. There are other theories which states that Nautamlal Bhagavanji Mehta in 21st January 1927 called his with this name.But in his biography Gandhi states that he is not worthy to call by such a name. Actually as a vignette for his sacrifice he is given this name.

For years, Gandhi and his adherents struggled to keep Muslims in the Congress Party (a major exit of many Muslim activists began in the 1930s), in the process enraging both Hindu Nationalists and Indian Muslim nationalists. (Gandhi was assassinated soon after Partition by Hindu nationalist Nathuram Godse, who believed that Gandhi was appeasing Muslims at the cost of Hindus.)    Politicians and community leaders on both sides whipped up mutual suspicion and fear, culminating in dreadful events such as the riots during the Muslim League's Direct Action Day of August 1946 in Calcutta, in which more than 5,000 people were killed and many more injured. As public order broke down all across northern India and Bengal, the pressure increased to seek a political partition of territories as a way to avoid a full-scale civil war.
Fro this comment, Gandhi said, "there was a time when people listened to me on how to fight the British without weapons, because then there were no weapons.... But today I am being told that my non-violence is of no use because it cannot stop the strife between Hindus and Muslims, therefore it is necessary to be armed for self defence".
For this Gandhi say "their is one time on that time people was heard my words how fight with Britishers without weapons now they are saying i am wrong they say for self help weapons are needed"
Gandhiji responed in this way - There was time when everyone listened to him how we can get rid of british govt by non violence, but now they say that its useless to be non violent to get freedom so we are using voilence for our protection only

  When a bowler bowls a wide or no ball then his team pays the penalty for this as they have to bowl another ball on which the batting team can make extra run. The batsman has to take run by running only as to get the benefit of the byes and leg byes(unless the ball goes pass the boundary line), but these runs can be taken into the scores of team and not in the batsman's personal score.
When a boller deliver wide or no ball, then his team has to bear punishment because he has to deliver one more extra ball, due to this batsman have a change to score one more run, bats has to run and take the run and claim for byes and legbyes(except when ball cross the boundry line) but this run will add in total of team run not in induvidul score of batsman.
Whenever a bowler bowls a wide ball or a no ball, it not only penalizes the bowling team as they have to bowl an extra bowl but it also enables the batsman to score run by running between the wickets, so that he can claim the bye or leg bye runs  (except when ball reaches the boundary). However these runs are add to the total score of team and not to the striker's individual tally.
When a baller gives wide or no ball, then his team has to suffer a penalty because he had done balling in which the batsman can't make a run. Batsman have to take run by running to give byes and leg byes. Instead when the ball goes beyond the boundary. But this score adds in the team's full score not in the strikers run.

Sometimes by elaborating the word pollution, disturbing elements are found. For example water is safe and necessary for the life but it is counted polluted of it is too salty. If someone drinks too much water then he may be burden for physical system and he can be died too. One ore example, by too much noise human can be mental which causes to psychosis and can be used as a weapon in war.
pollution is difficult for the human life. for example water is necessary for humans but more consuming of water also burdens the health .in the same way more pollution also kills human beings
  Sometimes, in the wide interpretation of the word pollution, production of unnatural pollutants harmful to the stability of the establishment is built into the system.  For example, water is harmless and is essential to life, but at very high density, it can be considered a pollutant: if any person drinks water in large quantity, there can be high load on the physical system and to such an extent that he can fall ill and even die.  Another example is that the mental balance of a person can be spoiled by excessive noise, the result of which is disturbance in the bodily functions and psychosis; this is used as an elephant in war.
Sometimes stabling the situation for complete sense of pollution can have dangerous parts. For instance water is a natural drink and is a need of life but on excess consumption it can turn to be a pollutant. If some person drinks water excessively it can put a lot of weight on his physiology and can result into death. Other example is that excessive pollution can distort the mental stability of a person which can result into problems for the body activities ans psychosis; this has been used in wars as a weapon.

On the road to implement Clean Water Act, 1977, permission was given to do research into removal of contaminants from navigable waters.  It is also necessary to legilate on using the best methods to look into water and thermal pollution.
Pollution began to draw major public attention in the United States between the mid-1950s and early 1970s, when Congress passed the Noise Control Act, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act and the National Environmental Policy Act.    Bad bouts of local pollution helped increase consciousness. PCB dumping in the Hudson River resulted in a ban by the EPA on consumption of its fish in 1974. Long-term dioxin contamination at Love Canal starting in 1947 became a national news story in 1978 and led to the Superfund legislation of 1980. Legal proceedings in the 1990s helped bring to light Chromium-6 releases in California--the champions of whose victims became famous. The pollution of industrial land gave rise to the name brownfield, a term now common in city planning. DDT was banned in most of the developed world after the publication of Rachel Carson's Silent Spring.
Point source pollution refers to contaminants that enter a waterway through a discrete conveyance, such as a pipe or ditch. Examples of sources in this category include discharges from a sewage treatment plant, a factory, or a city storm drain. The U.S. Clean Water Act (CWA) defines point source for regulatory enforcement purposes.[8] The CWA definition of point source was amended in 1987 to include municipal storm sewer systems, as well as industrial stormwater, such as from construction sites
Clean water act way 1977 sanshodan important permission for this contaminant navigable water.

It is useful to consider that environmental policy comprises two major terms: environment and policy. Environment primarily refers to the ecological dimension (ecosystems), but can also take account of social dimension (quality of life) and an economic dimension (resource management). [2] Policy can be defined as a "course of action or principle adopted or proposed by a government, party, business or individual" [3]. Thus, environmental policy focuses on problems arising from human impact on the environment, which retroacts onto human society by having a (negative) impact on human values such as good health or the 'clean and green' environment.    Environmental issues generally addressed by environmental policy include (but are not limited to) air and water pollution, waste management, ecosystem management, biodiversity protection, and the protection of natural resources, wildlife and endangered species. Relatively recently, environmental policy has also attended to the communication of environmental issues
On a large scale, such simple solutions were probably effective in the earlier centuries, when the physical existence only was the focus, population and its density were low, technologies were simple and their unintended effects were soft.  But such conditions did not last long.  In addition to this, modern technologies did not have capable methods to evauate the concentration of the effects.  Use of statistical methods to evaluate led to the appreciation of the possible dangers in these issues; assurance of the estimates is available by these methods, but choice of the specified model is not practical, and also, debate on the direct effect of the environment on the mankind has become very effective.
In one big environmental pollution is one general starting words big important , when physical astitva are necessary
On a large scale these simple treatments would be in use from the begining of primary centuries, when physical existence was very essential, human population and desity was low, technology were very simple and their bye products were mild. But this state does not continue for long. In addition to this modern technology did not have effective means of concenteration. The use statistical methods in evaluation of results made available currency for probale loss in such cases, where assurance of estimate is given but the selection of intended model is impractical in addition to this, the effect on human being not directly caused by climate became important.

In 1933, persecution of the Jews became active Nazi policy, but at first laws were not as rigorously obeyed or as devastating as in later years. Such clauses, known as Aryan paragraphs, had been postulated previously by antisemites and enacted in many private organizations.    On April 1, 1933, Jewish doctors, shops, lawyers and stores were boycotted. Only six days later, the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service was passed, banning Jews from being employed in government. This law meant that Jews were now indirectly and directly dissuaded or banned from privileged and upper-level positions reserved for “Aryan” Germans. From then on, Jews were forced to work at more menial positions, beneath non-Jews.    On August 25, 1933, the Haavara Agreement was signed, which allowed 60,000 German Jews to emigrate to Palestine by 1939.    On August 2, 1934, President Paul von Hindenburg died. No new president was appointed; instead the powers of the chancellor and president were combined into the office of Führer. This, and a tame government with no opposition parties, allowed Adolf Hitler totalitarian control of law-making. The army also swore an oath of loyalty personally to Hitler, giving him power over the military; this position allowed him to easily create more pressure on the Jews than ever before
I have received many letters asking me to declare my stand on the persecution of the Jews in Germany and on Arab-Jews.  It is not like I can give my answer to this difficult question without any scruples.  My sympathy is with the Jews.  I know them closely from the time I was in South Africa, and some of them have become my friends for life.  I came to know about the long persecution through these friends only.  They have been kept as untouchables in Jews religion.  But my sympathy will not take me away from reason.  Dfivision of a nation for the Jews does not appeal to me.  Is sanction there in the Bible and on what basis are they asking for Philippine in return?  Why do they, who love other people in the world,  not make home in the country where they are born and where they are earning a livelihood?  Palestine belongs to Arabs, just as as England belongs to British and France to the French.  It is improper and finhuman for the Jews to rule over the Arabs.  Whatever is happening today in Palestine can not be proved right from any perspective of customs and good practices.
I got many letters and they asked me my opinion about the persecutions of the Jews in Germany .it not that in this critical situation i gave the answer without any tension.
I received a letter asking the reaction of jews in Germany, I always have sympathy towards jews. I know jew during the time of Africa and some of them are my life time friends. Jews are discarded by christians. Due to this only jews are demanding for their birth place philistin

In 1998, the first mobile business was tried in Finland, whem in Espo two Coca-Cola vending machines were involved in linkage with SMS sales. Gradually this idea spread nd in 1999, Philippines launched the first commercial mobile payment project on the mobile operator Globe and Smart. Today mobile payments are used very widely in Asia, Africa and selected European markets, in uses like starting from mobie banking, mobile credit card, to mobile business. For example, in Philippines it is not unusual that somebody's entire salary is paid to settle the mobile bill. In Kenya the limit for funds transfer from one mobile banking account to the other is 10 lakhs American dollars. In India, if the utilities bill is paid through the mobile, 5% discount is available. In Astonia, the Government caught people collecting parking fee in cash, which is a crime, therafter the government announced that for parking fee settlement, only mobile payment through SMS is valid, and today in Astonia, all the parking fee is controlled through mobile and in this process the crime has ended.
In 1998 Finland try the first mobile payment when Aspo two COCO-cola shelling machine was capable to payment by SMS.so the this thought is distributed and In 1999 Philipins start the mobile operator global and smart commercial mobile payment system.Today mobile payment is via mobile banking,mobile credit card these are use to vary largely in Asia,Africa and selected European market.for example In philipins is not common the hole salary in payment the mobile bill.In Kenya the the money transfer limit is 10 million American dollar via one mobile banking account to another account.In India get a 5% discount to payment the application bill via mobile.Government got the criminal to take the cash parking fee in Astoniya,So the government is declare the payment is via mobile is acceptable for parking and today the all parking fee is control by the mobile in Astoniya and for this process the crime is totally end.
first premium-rate media content delivered via the SMS system was the world's first paid downloadable ringing tones, as commercially launched by Saunalahti (later Jippii Group, now part of Elisa Group) in 1998. Initially only Nokia branded phones could handle them. By 2002 the ringtone business globally had exceeded one billion US dollars of service revenues, and nearly 5 billion dollars by 2008[citation needed].    The Value-added service provider (VASP) providing the content submits the message to the mobile operator's SMSC(s) using a TCP/IP protocol such as the short message peer-to-peer protocol (SMPP) or the External Machine Interface (EMI). The SMSC delivers the text using the normal Mobile Terminated delivery procedure. The subscribers are charged extra for receiving this premium content; the revenue is typically divided between the mobile network operator and the VASP either through revenue share or a fixed transport fee. Submission to the SMSC is usually handled by a third party such as Itelebill, Zong or Daopay.
The first commercial deployment of a short message service center (SMSC) was by Aldiscon (now Acision) with Telia (now TeliaSonera) in Sweden in 1993[21], followed by Fleet Call (now Nextel)[citation needed] in the US, Telenor in Norway[citation needed] and BT Cellnet (now O2 UK)[citation needed] later in 1993. All first installations of SMS gateways were for network notifications sent to mobile phones, usually to inform of voice mail messages. The first commercially sold SMS service was offered to consumers, as a person-to-person text messaging service by Radiolinja (now part of Elisa) in Finland in 1993. It should be noted that most early GSM mobile phone handsets did not support the ability to send SMS text messages, and Nokia was the only handset manufacturer whose total GSM phone line in 1993 supported user-sending of SMS text messages.    Initial growth was slow, with customers in 1995 sending on average only 0.4 messages per GSM customer per month.[22] One factor in the slow takeup of SMS was that operators were slow to set up charging systems, especially for prepaid subscribers, and eliminate billing fraud which was possible by changing SMSC settings on individual handsets to use the SMSCs of other operators

Another point of controversy is how to anticipate how much the emerging economies like India and China to lessen their emissions. According to the report of Hall, the gross national Co2 emissions of China may be greater that America, but china has said that per capita emissions are less than America by 5 times and because of that these restrictions should not be imposed on it.India has also repeated this fact,which had been exempted from Kyoto restriction, and which is the largest source of industrial emissions. However the U.S contends that if they must bear the cost of reducing emissions, then China should do the same.
  Amother issue of the debate is what can be expected from emerging economies like India and China regarding the levels to which they will reduce their emissions.  According to the status report, China's gross national CO2 emissions can be higher than America's, but China said that the per capita emissions is five times less than America's, so these restrictions should not apply to them.  India also has echoed this argument, and it is exempted from implementing the Kyoto regulations and it is big source of industrial emissions.  However, the U.S. contends that if they must bear the cost of reducing emissions, then China should do the same.

In 1997 the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) investigated the well water and concluded that cancerous effects in personnel exposed to the water was unlikely. According to a federal investigation, ATSDR investigators overlooked evidence of benzene in the water when preparing the report.[7]    On 28 April 2009 the ATSDR admitted that the water had been contaminated with benzene and withdrew the 1997 report.[8] The benzene most likely occurred as a result of 800,000 gallons of fuel that leaked from the base fuel farm during the years in question. The fuel leaks occurred near the main well that serves Hadnot Point, location of enlisted and officer's quarters and the base hospital.[9] For unknown reasons, the presence of benzene in the water had been omitted from the official report that the USMC submitted for federal health review in 1992, in spite of the USMC being aware of the presence of the chemical. The report had been prepared by a contractor, Baker Corp.[10] State officials had also reportedly informed the ATSDR in 1994 about the presence of benzene in the water.
This united states Environmental protection agency in 1st January 1960 started one manak for the human health protect from the air pollution.

The SI unit of activity is the becquerel (Bq). One Bq is defined as one transformation (or decay) per second. Since any reasonably-sized sample of radioactive material contains many atoms, a Bq is a tiny measure of activity; amounts on the order of GBq (gigabecquerel, 1 x 109 decays per second) or TBq (terabecquerel, 1 x 1012 decays per second) are commonly used. Another unit of radioactivity is the curie, Ci, which was originally defined as the amount of radium emanation (radon-222) in equilibrium with of one gram of pure radium, isotope Ra-226. At present it is equal, by definition, to the activity of any radionuclide decaying with a disintegration rate of 3.7 × 1010 Bq. The use of Ci is presently discouraged by the SI.    Nuclides produced as daughters are also called radiogenic nuclides, whether they themselves are stable or not. A number of naturally occurring radionuclides are short-lived radiogenic nuclides that are daughters of radioactive primordial nuclides. Other naturally-occurring radioactive nuclides are cosmogenic nuclides, formed by cosmic ray bombardment of material in the Earth's atmosphere or crust. For a summary table showing the number of stable nuclides and of radioactive nuclides in each category known as nuclides.

There are different kinds of pitches, hence there is variation in the amount of bounce, spin and speed experienced by the bowler. It is easy to face balls on a hard pitch because the bounce is higher but uniform.A dry pitch is bad for the batsman since the cracks in it help a spinner to get a good spin.Wet pitches or green pitches(ones covered in grass)help a fast bowler to get extra bounce.This kind of pitch may aid a fast bowler during the start of a match, but as the match proceeds, it is advantageous to the batsman.
Pitch conditions can be different, due to which the bowler can get different bounce, spin and speed. It is easy to bat on hard pitch because the ball gets high but even bounce on it. Dry pitch is considered bad for batting because cracks emerge on this type of pitch and in these conditions the spinner can play an important part. Moist pitch or pitch having grass cover, which is called green pitch, helps fast bowler to get extra bounce. This type of pitch helps fast bowler through out the match. However, as the match progresses this type of pitch becomes better for batting.
The "condition" of the pitch has a significant bearing on the match  and this determines the bounce,spin and direction of the bowler.it is easy to bat in solid pitch as the bounce of the ball is predictable.But dry pitch is not suitable for batting as the spinner can determine the pace of the game.Green Pitches are good for fast bowling and bounces.Even thought these types of pitches are helpful for bowlers as the match progresses this allow batsman to  play well.
The stability of the pitch can vary and because of this the bounce, spin and pace obtained to the bowler may vary. In a hard pitch it is easy to bat since the bounce on this pitch may be high but same. Dry pitch is considered as bad for the batsman since cracks are formed in these and when it happens so spinner can play a good role, wet pitch or grass filled pitch( which is called as green pitch)helps good fast bowlers to get more bounce,these type of pitches help the bowlers during the entire period of the match, but as the match progresses it becomes more and more better for batting.

Anti satist were in a form where their views are for that India which is not subjugated under any government. Their idea were that in one nation self rule means that every person is the administration for themselves and no government can enforce laws on them. During some instances they've called themselves as philosophical anarchist. In their understanding a independent India existence is due to the thousands small self-dependent communities(possibly Talstoy's idea) who without causing troubles to others govern themselves. It didn't mean that they wanted the  Administrative body established by the Britishers to be nationalized for which they said India is to be made England. Not being fluent with British type of parliament after independence caused them to dissolve the congress party to establish direct democracy.
Gandhi- enemy of state: The state of vision he envisaged was India not be a subordinate under any Government, he opined that a nation should have true self rule meaning every person rules himself, so that let it not be a nation in which it imposes any law on the people, on many occasions he described himself to be a philosophical anarchist. He meant that an independent India’s integrity depended on thousands of small self dependent provinces ruled on its own, which does not mean the established administrative system be given over to Indian nationals for which he remarked converting Hindustan to Englishstan. The British type of Parliamentary system on which he did not believe in, he wished after Indian independence wanted to dismantle the Congress party and establish direct democratic system.
Gandhi believed in the govt without any intervention. Anti statis wanted the same govt.in some occasions he said himself as philosophical anarchist.independence meant for every small people.he wanted direct democracy in india.
anti statist in that way where there is view of indian where government is not.his opinion was that in one country self rule and its every body rule on its own.and there is no other such state where law ios there.in some place its own philosophical anarchist .in his way the meaning of independent is among that small small self dependent group(thought of tallastoy)those who dont didturb others and rule themselves the meaning is not that british indians are there and they told that they want to make hindusthan as englishthanon the british way of rule without trusting the cause and after the independent of india the congress party was bhung with direct democracy

The Sindh Assembly passed a resolution making it a demand in 1935. Iqbal, Jouhar and others then worked hard to draft Mohammad Ali Jinnah, who had till then worked for Hindu-Muslim unity, to lead the movement for this new nation. By 1930, Jinnah had begun to despair of the fate of minority communities in a united India and had begun to argue that mainstream parties such as the Congress, of which he was once a member, were insensitive to Muslim interests.    The 1932 communal award which seemed to threaten the position of Muslims in Hindu-majority provinces catalysed the resurgence of the Muslim League, with Jinnah as its leader.
Even so, taking into account a long  correspondence between Gandhi and Jinna on the issue of Pakistan, Jack Holmer says - "Though Gandhi was personally against partition, he gave an indication of his agreement, based on which Congress and Muslim League in the temporary Government came to an agreement to first get the freedom and later decide on the question of partition by popular vote in the districts where Muslims were in majority"...

Indian books has described in emotional and beautiful way about the Ganges.
Indian herditary or litarature is clearly said that its very important to us to create our nation is big heritage one.

The Indian state of Punjab was created in 1947, when the Partition of India split the former Raj province of Punjab between India and Pakistan. The mostly Muslim western part of the province became Pakistan's Punjab Province; the mostly Sikh and Hindu eastern part became India's Punjab state. Many Hindus and Sikhs lived in the west, and many Muslims lived in the east, and so the partition saw many people displaced and much intercommunal violence.    Lahore and Amritsar were at the center of the problem, the British were not sure where to place them - make them part of India or Pakistan. The British decided to give Lahore to Pakistan, whilst Amritsar became part of India. Areas in west Punjab such as Lahore, Rawalpindi, Multan, Gujart, had a large Sikh population and many of the residents were attacked or killed by radical Muslims.[citation needed] On the other side in East Punjab cities such as Amritsar, Ludhiana, and Gurdaspur had a majority Muslim population in which many of them were wiped out by Sikh guerrillas who launched an all out war against the Muslims.
Keeping a double stand like this on the issue of Indian partition, Gandhi opened the areas of perceptions from both Hindus and Muslims.  Muhammad Ali Jinnah and contemporary Pakistanis accused Gandhi of undermining the political rights of the Muslims.  Vinayak Damodar Savarkar and his colleagues blamed Gandhi and accused that he was coaxing the Muslims, that he was indifferent to the crimes committed against the Hindus, and that he had already accepted the formation of Pakistan (though he publicly announced that he may be cut into two pieces before partition).  This is even today politically debatable, as Pakistani-American historian Ayesha Jalal gives the logic that Gandhi and Congress were not willing to share power with Muslim League.  Other Hindu nationalist and political leader Pravin Togadia also considers this issue in the leadership of Gandhi, and also suggests that partition happened because of the extreme weakness of his group.
In the mater of India division this situation ,Gandhi put think on two sides Hindus and Muslims .Mohammad Ali zen and other Pakistani insult Gandhi.
Gandhiji was liked by hindus as well as muslim thats one reason he was agiant division. Mohd Ali Jinna told that Gandhiji is in favour of hindus and not Muslims so we demand separate state pakistan. Vinayak Damodar Savarkar blamed gandhiji that he is supporting Muslim and is not aware of fact the Hindus beings tortured by Muslim. So gandhiji finaly opted for the division. According to writer Ayesha Jalal( aa Americian pakistani writer) informs that reason of division is that Indian Congress was not in favour of party muslim league and dont want muslim leage to be a part of Indian Govt. Another Hindu writer Pramod Togadia division was done due to weakness of gandhi only

English King King Edward I, in 1272, in London by a prior proclamation imposed restriction on use of sea-coal, because its smoke became a problem. But in England fuel was so common that the initial name was given to it because it was brought from far away sea coasts loaded into pushcarts.  Air pollution by far remained a problem, specially during industrial revolution thereafter. Recently this spread through the Great Smog of 1952. The same city saw a big problem in water quality, this was the Great Stink in Thames in 1858, because of this only soon after this, London sewerage system was built.
When the USACE processes an application for an Individual Permit, it must publish/issue a public notice (typically in the Federal Register) describing the proposed action described in the permit application. The public notice must be issued no later than fifteen days after the Corps determines the application to be complete. Although the Corps District Engineer makes the decision to grant a permit, the EPA Administrator may veto a permit if it is not reasonable. Before making such a decision, however, EPA must consult with the USACE. A wetlands permit expires after five years.    When a state wants a permit, they make sure that all other states being affected are aware they will be sent a copy of the request and the state is able to write a recommendation. A state permit also expires after five years.
King Edward I of England banned the burning of sea-coal by proclamation in London in 1272, after its smoke had become a problem.[6][7] But the fuel was so common in England that this earliest of names for it was acquired because it could be carted away from some shores by the wheelbarrow. Air pollution would continue to be a problem in England, especially later during the industrial revolution, and extending into the recent past with the Great Smog of 1952. This same city also recorded one of the earlier extreme cases of water quality problems with the Great Stink on the Thames of 1858, which led to construction of the London sewerage system soon afterward.
England king Edward1 banded on the use of sea coal burn in London,because this smoke creates problem .air pollution become a big problem in Hali great smog of 1952 it expanded more.

W.G.Grace started his long carrier in 1865; it is said that his carrier took revolution in this game. The Ashes formed during England and Australia match in 1882. This was the famous test match. Test matches brought up during 1888-89 when South Africa played against England during two decade before first world war. That was known as "The Golden Age of Cricket". This name is result of adverse situation of war. But great players developed during this time and they played great cricket. Especially County matches and Test matches grown-up.
W G Grace started his long career in 1865; his career is often said to have revolutionised the sport.[20] The rivalry between England and Australia gave birth to The Ashes in 1882 and this has remained Test cricket's most famous contest[citation needed]. Test cricket began to expand in 1888–89 when South Africa played England. The last two decades before the First World War have been called the "Golden Age of cricket". It is a nostalgic name prompted by the collective sense of loss resulting from the war, but the period did produce some great players and memorable matches, especially as organised competition at county and Test level developed.
The "Great Cricketer", W G Grace, made his first-class debut in 1865. His feats did much to increase the game's popularity and he introduced technical innovations which revolutionised the game, particularly in batting.The growth of cricket in the mid and late 19th century was assisted by the development of the railway network. For the first time, teams from a long distance apart could play one other without a prohibitively time-consuming journey. Spectators could travel longer distances to matches, increasing the size of crowds.    In 1864, another bowling revolution resulted in the legalisation of overarm and in the same year Wisden Cricketers' Almanack was first published.
In 1859, a team of leading English professionals set off to North America on the first-ever overseas tour and, in 1862, the first English team toured Australia.    Between May and October 1868, a team of Australian Aborigines toured England in what was the first Australian cricket team to travel overseas.    In 1877, an England touring team in Australia played two matches against full Australian XIs that are now regarded as the inaugural Test matches. The following year, the Australians toured England for the first time and were a spectacular success. No Tests were played on that tour but more soon followed and, at The Oval in 1882, arguably the most famous match of all time gave rise to The Ashes. South Africa became the third Test nation in 1889.

This game had made leading growth in 18th century and that became national game of England. Bet played leading role in that and rich fans prepared 11 players team. In 1707 Cricket was very famous in London and a huge crowd gathered in Artillery Ground of finsbury. Single Wicket game had attracted most of the people. Bowling started in 1760 where bowlers started to pitch the ball instead of full toss. To play bounce ball, tremendous design revolution came in bats. The old hockey type sticks formed more flatter.

The game underwent major development in the 18th century and became the national sport of England. Betting played a major part in that development with rich patrons forming their own "select XIs". Cricket was prominent in London as early as 1707 and large crowds flocked to matches on the Artillery Ground in Finsbury. The single wicket form of the sport attracted huge crowds and wagers to match. Bowling evolved around 1760 when bowlers began to pitch the ball instead of rolling or skimming it towards the batsman. This caused a revolution in bat design because, to deal with the bouncing ball, it was necessary to introduce the modern straight bat in place of the old "hockey stick" shape. The Hambledon Club was founded in the 1760s and, for the next 20 years until the formation of MCC and the opening of Lord's Old Ground in 1787, Hambledon was both the game's greatest club and its focal point. MCC quickly became the sport's premier club and the custodian of the Laws of Cricket. New Laws introduced in the latter part of the 18th century included the three stump wicket and leg before wicket (lbw).
The first famous clubs were London and Dartford in the early 18th century. London played its matches on the Artillery Ground, which still exists. Others followed, particularly Slindon in Sussex which was backed by the Duke of Richmond and featured the star player Richard Newland. There were other prominent clubs at Maidenhead, Hornchurch, Maidstone, Sevenoaks, Bromley, Addington, Hadlow and Chertsey.    But far and away the most famous of the early clubs was Hambledon in Hampshire. It started as a parish organisation that first achieved prominence in 1756. The club itself was founded in the 1760s and was well patronised to the extent that it was the focal point of the game for about thirty years until the formation of MCC and the opening of Lord's Cricket Ground in 1787. Hambledon produced several outstanding players including the master batsman John Small and the first great fast bowler Thomas Brett. Their most notable opponent was the Chertsey and Surrey bowler Edward "Lumpy" Stevens, who is believed to have been the main proponent of the flighted delivery.    It was in answer to the flighted, or pitched, delivery that the straight bat was introduced. The old "hockey stick" style of bat was only really effective against the ball being trundled or skimmed along the ground.
Although many "traditional" cricket fans objected to the shorter form of the game, limited overs cricket did have the advantage of delivering a result to spectators within a single day; it did improve cricket's appeal to younger or busier people; and it did prove commercially successful.    The first limited overs international match took place at Melbourne Cricket Ground in 1971 as a time-filler after a Test match had been abandoned because of heavy rain on the opening days. It was tried simply as an experiment and to give the players some exercise, but turned out to be immensely popular. Limited overs internationals (LOIs or ODIs, after One-day Internationals) have since grown to become a massively popular form of the game, especially for busy people who want to be able to see a whole match. The International Cricket Council reacted to this development by organising the first Cricket World Cup in England in 1975, with all the Test playing nations taking part.

Measures of air pollutant emissions are those representative measures which tell us the extent of the pollutant spread in the air by the process related to the emission of that pollutant.  These measures are usually expressed in terms of weight measurement, volume, distance or as the total quantity of the pollutant emitted divided by the pollutants emitted per unit of the concerned process (like the micro particulates emitted per megagram of coal burnt).  Measures of this type make it easy to measure the emissions from different sources of the air pollution.  In most cases, these measures are averages of the available data on the quality indicator chosen, and usually long term averages.
Air pollutants are representative standard for component of emission which tells the quantity of emitted pollutants in air by the activity related to emission of that pollutant. These components are generally expressed by quantity of pollutants, distance or expressed by dividing duration of pollutant activity with an unit of pollutant (like micro emission per megagram of coal). This type of component help in assessing emitted emission from different sources of air pollution. In maximum cases, these components are average of available data acceptable quality, and normally considered long duration period.
Air pollution is the introduction of chemicals, particulate matter, or biological materials that cause harm or discomfort to humans or other living organisms, or damages the natural environment into the atmosphere.    The atmosphere is a complex dynamic natural gaseous system that is essential to support life on planet Earth. Stratospheric ozone depletion due to air pollution has long been recognized as a threat to human health as well as to the Earth's ecosystems.    Indoor air pollution and urban air quality are listed as two of the world's worst pollution problems in the 2008 Blacksmith Institute World's Worst Polluted Places report.Pollutants can be classified as either primary or secondary. Usually, primary pollutants are substances directly emitted from a process, such as ash from a volcanic eruption, the carbon monoxide gas from a motor vehicle exhaust or sulfur dioxide released from factories.    Secondary pollutants are not emitted directly. Rather, they form in the air when primary pollutants react or interact. An important example of a secondary pollutant is ground level ozone — one of the many secondary pollutants that make up photochemical smog.
Air polluted production like generally it comes from the polluted related expanded air in this way air comes in different ways.

The reason of difference in scenarios is they are using various modules to emission of greenhouse gas. They are made different scale for climate sensitivity, although study is focused up to 2100 duration, Even if greenhouse gas level are stabilized then also they are hoping that it will worming and increase in level of ocean.
Due to so much scenarios of change different modules are set up for the emission of greenhouse gas and different measures for climate sensitivity, though majority of the course is for the period up to 2100,then also even if the level of green house gas level becomes stable, prospect is there for warming and rise in sea level.
Variation in findings is due to difference in measurement of greenhouse gas and also due to various measuring meathods of climate sensitivity .Even though most of the studies are concentrating on 2100 and greenhouse gas emissions could become constant but warming and rise in ocean level is expected.
Differences in results and scenarios are because of differences in measurement of the greenhouse gases. Different standards have been set up regarding climate sensitivity, though major research on this has been done till 2100.Though the emission of greenhouse gases can be stopped, the warming and the rise in oceanic levels is inevitable.

Coming of light into the earth, which is called as irradiance, is said to have probably lessened Global warming in the 20th century, since at that time only little light came to earth. From 1960 to 1990 human made aerosols have much more increased this phenomenon. Scientist have told with 66-90 percent belief that human made aerosols,including volcanic activity lessens global warming a little bit and green house gas warming which is seen until now could have been much more if these lessening agents were not there.
Light rays on earth, called irradiance, may have caused reduction in global dimming in the 20th century, because less light reached the earth then.  From 1960 to 1990, this situation got magnified by the man made aerocells.  Scientists have said that it can be said with 66-90 percent confidence level thatman made aerocells, and the volcanic processes reduce the global warming and green house gases will raise this warming more than what is experienced till now if they are not the reason for its reduction.
sun rays are on the earth  is called irradiance by which global dimming is lessened
Irradiance, or the absorption of light by the earth may have reduced global warming in the 20th century. In 1960 to 1990, the earth had received lesser light in comparison. Man-produced aerosols increased the levels, and if they are not present, volcanic actions and emissions of greenhouse gases are likely to be harmful.

In 19th century roundarm bowling was replaced by Underarm bowling. Both types were suspicious. County clubs started forming during this time such as Sussex CCC, who formed County Championship. British Empire had provided valuable contribution for this game. During mid of 19th century, this game was transformed to India, North America, Caribbean, South Africa, Australia and New Zeland. In 1944, first time match held between United States and Canada (However neither of the states declared as a Test Players)
The 19th century saw underarm bowling replaced by first roundarm and then overarm bowling. Both developments were controversial. Organisation of the game at county level led to the creation of the county clubs, starting with Sussex CCC in 1839, which ultimately formed the official County Championship in 1890. Meanwhile, the British Empire had been instrumental in spreading the game overseas and by the middle of the 19th century it had become well established in India, North America, the Caribbean, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand. In 1844, the first international cricket match took place between the United States and Canada (although neither has ever been ranked as a Test-playing nation).    In 1859, a team of England players went on the first overseas tour (to North America) and in 1862, an English team made the first tour of Australia. In 1876–77, an England team took part in the first-ever Test match at the Melbourne Cricket Ground against Australia.
Cricket certainly thrived after the Restoration in 1660 and is believed to have first attracted gamblers making large bets at this time. In 1664, the "Cavalier" Parliament passed the Gaming Act 1664 which limited stakes to £100, although that was still a fortune at the time,[1] equivalent to about £12 thousand in present day terms [7]. Cricket had certainly become a significant gambling sport by the end of the 17th century. There is a newspaper report of a "great match" played in Sussex in 1697 which was 11-a-side and played for high stakes of 50 guineas a side.[6]    With freedom of the press having been granted in 1696, cricket for the first time could be reported in the newspapers. But it was a long time before the newspaper industry adapted sufficiently to provide frequent, let alone comprehensive, coverage of the game. During the first half of the 18th century, press reports tended to focus on the betting rather than on the play.
Cricket faced its first real crisis during the 18th century when major matches virtually ceased during the Seven Years War. This was largely due to shortage of players and lack of investment. But the game survived and the "Hambledon Era" proper began in the mid-1760s.    Cricket faced another major crisis at the beginning of the 19th century when a cessation of major matches occurred during the culminating period of the Napoleonic Wars. Again, the causes were shortage of players and lack of investment. But, as in the 1760s, the game survived and a slow recovery began in 1815.    MCC was itself the centre of controversy in the Regency period, largely on account of the enmity between Lord Frederick Beauclerk and George Osbaldeston. In 1817, their intrigues and jealousies exploded into a match-fixing scandal with the top player William Lambert being banned from playing at Lord's Cricket Ground for life. Gambling scandals in cricket have been going on since the 17th century.    In the 1820s, cricket faced a major crisis of its own making as the campaign to allow roundarm bowling gathered pace.

By this time, Hindustani had become the general public's language. To distinguish themselves from the general masses, the learned Muslims used to write in Urdu (filled with Persian and Arabic vocabulary), while Khadiboli became prominent among educated Hindus. Khadiboli with heavily Sanskritized vocabulary or Sahityik Hindi (Literary Hindi) was popularized by the writings of Swami Dayananda Saraswati, Bhartendu Harishchandra and others. Bhartendu Harishchandra preferred Braj Bhasha for poetry, but for prose, he deliberately used Khadiboli. Other important writers of this period are Mahavir Prasad Dwivedi, Maithili Sharan Gupt, R N Tripathi and Gopala Sharan Sinha. The rising numbers of newspapers and magazines made Khadiboli popular among the educated people. Chandrakanta, written by Devaki Nandan Khatri, is considered the first authentic work of prose in the Adhunik kaal (modern period). A story of magical characters, kings and kingdoms, it reminds one of The Lord of the Rings series and was successfully manifested into an eponymous TV Serial.The person who brought realism in the Hindi prose literature was Munshi Premchand, who is considered as the most revered figure in the world of Hindi fiction and progressive movement. Before Premchand, the Hindi literature revolved around fairy or magical tales, entertaining stories and religious themes. Premchand's novels have been translated into many other languages.

because the universe is like a big magic place which always makes you far from the god and you don't realize it,
Because the world is dual, where happiness exists there sorrow also does, therefore infinite (perennial) happiness can be achieved only by getting rid of this dualism, and this is called salvation.
Since the world is full of opposites and where there is happiness, there is sorrow also, hence ultimate(permanent) happiness will be obtained only by elimination of opposites and this is called salvation
The world, being dynamic, has happiness as well as unhappiness. Thus achieving a state of internal happiness is vital to gain Moksha.

For "Cricket" word, the word count is believed as a source. In the earliest known reference to the sport in 1598, it is called creckett. It met between Middle-age business connection, south-est England and county of flanders, which supposed to be Duchy of Burgundy. This name supposed to be derived from Krik(-e) of Middle Dutch or in old English Kris or Krise which means stick (Baisakhi in Hindi). That sounds like Old French word Criquet which means a kind of stick or club. In Samuel johnson's directory, he described cricket as "cryce" which means Saskon-A Stick. One more probable evidence is middle dutch word krickstoel which means - a long beneath stul which is used in church for resting knee, that looks like old age long two wicket and stumps. Bonn University's europian language expert Heiner gillmeister believes that Cricket is derived for middle dutch Hockey - met de (krik ket)sen means along with back side of stick.
In 1598,[9] a court case referred to a sport called creckett being played by boys at the Royal Grammar School, Guildford around 1550. This is the sport's earliest definite mention. It is believed that it was originally a children's game but references around 1610[17] indicate that adults had started playing it and the earliest reference to inter-parish or village cricket occurs soon afterwards. In 1624, a player called Jasper Vinall was killed when he was struck on the head during a match between two parish teams in Sussex.[18]     The first English touring team on board ship at Liverpool in 1859    During the 17th century, numerous references indicate the growth of cricket in the south-east of England. By the end of the century, it had become an organised activity being played for high stakes and it is believed that the first professionals appeared in the years following the Restoration in 1660. A newspaper report survives of "a great cricket match" with eleven players a side that was played for high stakes in Sussex in 1697 and this is the earliest known reference to a cricket match of such importance.The game underwent major development in the 18th century and became the national sport of England. Betting played a major part in that development with rich patrons forming their own "select XIs". Cricket was prominent in London as early as 1707 and large crowds flocked to matches on the Artillery Ground in Finsbury. The single wicket form of the sport attracted huge crowds and wagers to match. Bowling evolved around 1760 when bowlers began to pitch the ball instead of rolling or skimming it towards the batsman. This caused a revolution in bat design because, to deal with the bouncing ball, it was necessary to introduce the modern straight bat in place of the old "hockey stick" shape. The Hambledon Club was founded in the 1760s and, for the next 20 years until the formation of MCC and the opening of Lord's Old Ground in 1787, Hambledon was both the game's greatest club and its focal point. MCC quickly became the sport's premier club and the custodian of the Laws of Cricket. New Laws introduced in the latter part of the 18th century included the three stump wicket and leg before wicket (lbw).
A number of words are thought to be possible sources for the term "cricket". In the earliest known reference to the sport in 1598 (see below), it is called creckett. The name may have been derived from the Middle Dutch krick(-e), meaning a stick; or the Old English cricc or cryce meaning a crutch or staff.[2] Another possible source is the Middle Dutch word krickstoel, meaning a long low stool used for kneeling in church and which resembled the long low wicket with two stumps used in early cricket.    According to Heiner Gillmeister, a European language expert of Bonn University, "cricket" derives from the Middle Dutch met de (krik ket)sen (i.e., "with the stick chase"), which also suggests a Dutch connection in the game's origin. It is more likely that the terminology of cricket was based on words in use in south east England at the time and, given trade connections with the County of Flanders, especially in the 15th century when it belonged to the Duchy of Burgundy, many Middle Dutch[3] words found their way into southern English dialects
West, East Flemish and Zealandic, was spoken in the modern region of West and East Flanders and Zeeland and also in the Département du Nord of what is now France but was then part of the County of Flanders ;  Brabantian was the language of the area covered by the modern Dutch province of North Brabant and the south of Gelderland; and the Belgian provinces of Flemish Brabant and Antwerp as well as the Brussels capital region;  Hollandic was mainly used in the present provinces of North and South Holland and parts of Utrecht;  Limburgish, spoken by the people in the provinces of modern Dutch and Belgian Limburg;  Low Saxon, spoken in the area of the modern provinces of Gelderland, Overijssel, Drenthe and parts of Groningen.    The last two of the Middle Dutch dialect groups mentioned above gradated into, respectively, Middle High German and Middle Low German, since these two areas border directly onto the German language-area in the narrow sense (i.e. that area where today German is the standard language). There was a dialect continuum, which was even more fluid than it is today.

Some of the more common soil contaminants are chlorinated hydrocarbons (CFH), heavy metals (such as chromium, cadmium--found in rechargeable batteries, and lead--found in lead paint, aviation fuel and still in some countries, gasoline), MTBE, zinc, arsenic and benzene. In 2001 a series of press reports culminating in a book called Fateful Harvest unveiled a widespread practice of recycling industrial byproducts into fertilizer, resulting in the contamination of the soil with various metals. Ordinary municipal landfills are the source of many chemical substances entering the soil environment (and often groundwater), emanating from the wide variety of refuse accepted, especially substances illegally discarded there, or from pre-1970 landfills that may have been subject to little control in the U.S. or EU. There have also been some unusual releases of polychlorinated dibenzodioxins, commonly called dioxins for simplicity, such as TCDD

State terrorism has been used to refer to terrorist acts by governmental agents or forces. This involves the use of state resources employed by a state's foreign policies, such as using its military to directly perform acts of terrorism. Professor of Political Science Michael Stohl cites the examples that include Germany’s bombing of London and the U.S. atomic destruction of Hiroshima during World War II. He argues that “the use of terror tactics is common in international relations and the state has been and remains a more likely employer of terrorism within the international system than insurgents." They also cite the First strike option as an example of the "terror of coercive diplomacy" as a form of this, which holds the world hostage with the implied threat of using nuclear weapons in "crisis management." They argue that the institutionalized form of terrorism has occurred as a result of changes that took place following World War II. In this analysis, state terrorism exhibited as a form of foreign policy was shaped by the presence and use of weapons of mass destruction, and that the legitimizing of such violent behavior led to an increasingly accepted form of this state behavior

Because of less clearnce, air pollution happens in places where people spend most of their time.  Radon (Rn) gas is a carcinogen, which comes out of the earth at some places and spreads in the houses.  Formaldehyde (H2CO) gas is emitted from building materials like carpets and plywood.  While dryinig, paints and solvents emit volatile organic compounds (VOCs).  Lead based paint can turn into dust and can go inside the body through breathing.  Deliberate air pollution is caused by air fresheners, incense and other scented materials.  Smoke from the stoves in which wood is burnt in a controlled manner, and from the fireplaces, can add in considerable quantities to the inner and outer air, the effect of smoking.  Insecticides' and chemicals' sprays without adequate ventillation can cause harmful effects by internal pollution.
Due reduced emission air pollution occur internally where people spend their maximum time. Radon gas which is a carcinogen emit from some part of earth accumulate inside houses. House hold items like carpet and plywood emit formaldehyde gas. On drying paint and solvent release Volatile Organic Compounds. Lead  paint can transform into dust  and can enter body with breathing. Desirable air pollution caused by air freshener, incense and other fragrant items. Controlled burning of wood in stove and smoke at fire place add considerable element of smoke in internal and external air. Use of insecticides and chemical spray without proper ventilation may lead to harmful internal air pollution.
International catastrophes such as the wreck of the Amoco Cadiz oil tanker off the coast of Brittany in 1978 and the Bhopal disaster in 1984 have demonstrated the universality of such events and the scale on which efforts to address them needed to engage. The borderless nature of atmosphere and oceans inevitably resulted in the implication of pollution on a planetary level with the issue of global warming. Most recently the term persistent organic pollutant (POP) has come to describe a group of chemicals such as PBDEs and PFCs among others. Though their effects remain somewhat less well understood owing to a lack of experimental data, they have been detected in various ecological habitats far removed from industrial activity such as the Arctic, demonstrating diffusion and bioaccumulation after only a relatively brief period of widespread use.    Growing evidence of local and global pollution and an increasingly informed public over time have given rise to environmentalism and the environmental movement, which generally seek to limit human impact on the environment.
For the scarcity of nikas air pollution happens where people mostly waste the time.Redan gas,one carcinogen,carpet and from the plywood formaldehyde.

For example, by combination of the three letters ka ma and la,  a word can be made as kamal and it has a meaning and so it is a word, but the word lakam also is made with these three words, but this word doesn't have a meaning and thus it is not a word.
For example the joining of three letters "Ka", "Ma" and "La" form the word "Kamal", which has a meaning (lotus), but "La-Ka-Ma" is made by joining the same letters, but lacks meaning, hence is not a word.

for example the combination of ka,ma,and la forms kamal and its meaning is also formed. Thus "kamal" is a word but"Lakam"is another combination of these three letters which does not give a meaning and due to this ,this is  not a word

The use of force by states is already thoroughly regulated under international law"[94] However, he also made clear that, "regardless of the differences between governments on the question of definition of terrorism, what is clear and what we can all agree on is any deliberate attack on innocent civilians, regardless of one's cause, is unacceptable and fits into the definition of terrorism.

Sun's activity will also be an effect that it will be warm stratosphere, the Green House gas theory predicts there is cooling. This trend has been observed since 1960 from the stratosphere is cooling. stratosphere ozone reduction also arises due to the coldness, the ozone depletion is not the end of the 1970s. Solar variation and volcanic activity due to the industrial age has not increased from 1950 until hot but cooling has happened. Peter Afokal and the United States in 2006, germany and other researchers in Switzerland found that the brightness of the sun has not changed from the last 1000 years. Solar cycles last 30 years caused the increase of only 0.07 percent. The very small contribution to global warming and the effect to.
One of the influence of sun's activity would be that stratosphere would become warm, whereas greenhouse gas theory forecasts it to become cold. Post 1960, this trend has been observed that stratosphere has only become cold.Reduction of stratospheric ozone leads to coolness, but ozone depletion did not happen till the decade of 1970. Due to solar variation and volcanic activities from industrial age till 1950, it did not become hot but has become cooler only. In 2006, Peter Foukal and other astrophysicists from USA, Germany and Switzerland found that in the last 1000 years there has been no net increase in sun's brightness. Due to solar cycle, in the last 30 years there is increase of only 0.07 %. For global warming effect this is a small but important contribution.
Another effect of solar processes is that the stratosphere gets warmer, whereas the greenhouse gas theory predicts a cooling there.  The tendency towards becoming cooler only is seen in the stratosphere after 1960.  Due to reduction of stratospheric ozone, cooling can also be the result, but depletion of ozone did not happen till the end of the decade 1970.  From the industrial age to 1950, temperature has not increased due to solar diversity and volcanic processes, on the contrary cooling has happened.  In 2006, Peter Foukal and other researchers of United States of America, Germany and Switzerland have foound that since the last 1000 years there is no net increase in the sun's brightness.  Because of the solar cycle, there is just o.o7 percent increase in the last 30 years.  This is a very small but significant contributor to global warming.
In sun one effect is also their in that stratosphere become hot,in that green house gas theory tells the future .it shows that from the 1960 stratosphere become cool.

The partition was promulgated in the Indian Independence Act 1947 and resulted in the dissolution of the British Indian Empire. The partition displaced up to 12.5 million people in the former British Indian Empire, with estimates of loss of life varying from several hundred thousand to a million.[1]    The partition of India included the geographical division of the Bengal province of British India into East Pakistan and West Bengal (India), and the similar partition of the Punjab province into West Punjab (later the Pakistani Punjab and Islamabad Capital Territory) and East Punjab (later the Indian Punjab, Haryana and Himachal Pradesh). The partition deal also included the division of state assets, including the British Indian Army, the Indian Civil Service and other administrative services, the Indian railways, and the central treasury.
  In principle Gandhi was opposed to the proposal of partition, as it was against his concept of spritual unity.  On 6 October 1946, he wrote in Harijan on the subject of formation of Pakistan by partitioning India:
Gandhi is opposite to partition because this is opposite to his rules and regulations in 6th October 1956 in hirjan he write about Pakistan division to India.
  Gandhiji was against the Partition of India and pakistan because it divides the unity of 2 major religions. He has written in the book of Harijan that he was not in favour of Partition on 6th Mar 1946

In present the earth moves around with the sun and the moon in outer space. The earth moves around its axis 366.26 times which is the time to complete one sidereal year which is equivalent to 365.26 solar days. The rotational axis of the earth is tilted perpendicularly at a distance of 23.6 across the orbital plane by which creates diverse weather conditions on the earth in one tropical year (365.24 solar days). The moon is the Earth's only known natural satellite, which started revolving around the earth about 4.53 billion years ago, creates oceanic tides, keeps the axis rotations steady and slows down rotations of the planet. During the initial history of the planet a comet bombardment helped in the formation of the oceaans.

The Global Service for Mobile communications (GSM), with the greatest worldwide number of users, succumbs to several security vulnerabilities. In the GSM, only the airway traffic between the Mobile Station (MS) and the Base Transceiver Station (BTS) is optionally encrypted with a weak and broken stream cipher (A5/1 or A5/2). The authentication is unilateral and also vulnerable. There are also many other security vulnerabilities and shortcomings[37]. Such vulnerabilities are inherent to SMS as one of the superior and well-tried services with a global availability in the GSM networks. SMS messaging has some extra security vulnerabilities due to its store-and-forward feature, and the problem of fake SMS that can be conducted via the Internet. When a user is roaming, SMS content passes through different networks, perhaps including the Internet, and is exposed to various vulnerabilities and attacks. Another concern arises when an adversary gets access to a phone and reads the previous unprotected messages

The HLR will set a flag against the destination account, indicating that it is unavailable for short message delivery, and store the SMSC's address in the Message Waiting Data (MWD) list for the destination party. Valid flags are Mobile Not Reachable Flag (MNRF), Memory Capacity Exceeded Flag (MCEF) and Mobile Not Reachable for GPRS (MNRG). The HLR will now start responding to SRI-for-SM requests with a failure, indicating the failure reason, and will automatically add the requesting SMSC's address to the MWD list for the destination party. (However if the SRI-for-SM message has priority flag set then the HLR will reply with VLR address if available)

He wrote that "It seems an uncivilized rule, moreso when one is a prisoner.Prisoners live difficult, dirty lives like animals." In 1903, He wrote, "I believe that I also belong to a pure race, as they do.But i agree that the whites in South Africa should be considered as a higher race." In his days in South Africa, Gandhiji often opposed the unfair treatment of Indians by the whites, and he describes this as,"It is definitely better than the Kaffirs."It is worth considering that the meaning of Kaffirs in Gandhiji's times was quite different than its meaning today.Gandhiji, in his articles, has urged some people in declaring themselves as a higher race.
The first writings of Gandhi on South Afrca are quite controversial. On 7 March, 1908, Gandhi wrote in "Indian Opinion" about his jail lif " Infidels are uncivilised in command - as inmates of jails more so.  They live hard, dirty and almost like animals".  In 1903, Gandhi wrote a commentary on immigrants' issue that "I concede that as much as they believe in the purity of their race, we also believe equally..we agree that in South Africa the white race has to be the better one".  During his time in South Africa, Gandhi opposed the social classification of Indians along with non-whites, about whom he describes that "undoubtedly and in total better than the infidels".  It needs attention that the word infidel had a different connotation in Gandhi's time than its present day usage.  These narratives of Gandi made it possible to accuse him as a racist by some people.
On 7th March,1908 Gandhi ji in Indian opinion has written about his jail life in South Africa.There was lot of difference between black and white in South Africa. White people hated black one.They thought that they are the great people.It was a different connotion used in its present day usage.

As with "terrorism" the concept of "state terrorism" is controversial.[92] The Chairman of the United Nations Counter-Terrorism Committee has stated that the Committee was conscious of 12 international Conventions on the subject, and none of them referred to State terrorism, which was not an international legal concept. If States abused their power, they should be judged against international conventions dealing with war crimes, international human rights and international humanitarian law.[93] Former United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan has said that it is "time to set aside debates on so-called 'state terrorism'. The use of force by states is already thoroughly regulated under international law"[94] However, he also made clear that, "regardless of the differences between governments on the question of definition of terrorism, what is clear and what we can all agree on is any deliberate attack on innocent civilians, regardless of one's cause, is unacceptable and fits into the definition of terrorism.State terrorism has been used to refer to terrorist acts by governmental agents or forces. This involves the use of state resources employed by a state's foreign policies, such as using its military to directly perform acts of terrorism. Professor of Political Science Michael Stohl cites the examples that include Germany’s bombing of London and the U.S. atomic destruction of Hiroshima during World War II. He argues that “the use of terror tactics is common in international relations and the state has been and remains a more likely employer of terrorism within the international system than insurgents." They also cite the First strike option as an example of the "terror of coercive diplomacy" as a form of this, which holds the world hostage with the implied threat of using nuclear weapons in "crisis management." They argue that the institutionalized form of terrorism has occurred as a result of changes that took place following World War II. In this analysis, state terrorism exhibited as a form of foreign policy was shaped by the presence and use of weapons of mass destruction, and that the legitimizing of such violent behavior led to an increasingly accepted form of this state behavior.
  Terrorism is a disputed matter, General Secretary of UNO and his Anti Terrorism Dept has pointed out 12 points for eradication / involvement of terrorism in any state. War crimes, Internationla Humanitatian law etc. Gen Secretary Koffe Ananan said the armed forces of each country should  use its armed force should abide international laws. It is also be ensured that Innocent Citizen should not be explioted in the name of Terrorism.

The ancient form of the pollution caused by the living beings was a natural result of their existence.  Effect of population size and its activities has fallen below the frame of the natural selection.  In this are included reduction of population at the regional level, or towards the end extinction of the species.  In the processes which were not clear, a new balance is established between their resultant modifications and adaptations.  For life of any form,mfor its existence, pollution has crossed the last boundary.
A number of experiments have found that decay rates of other modes of artificial and naturally-occurring radioisotopes are, to a high degree of precision, unaffected by external conditions such as temperature, pressure, the chemical environment and electric, magnetic or gravitational fields. Comparison of laboratory experiments over the last century, studies of the Oklo natural nuclear reactor (which exemplified the effects of thermal neutrons on nuclear decay rates), and astrophysical observations of the luminosity decays of distant supernovae (which occurred long ago so the light has taken a great deal of time to reach us), for example, strongly indicate that decay rates have been constant (at least to within the limitations of small experimental errors) as a function of time as well.
pollution caused by human from ancient and due to over popullation are called as natural selection pollution. Due to which any breed of wave off from earth or decreasing species.

Some economists have tried to estimate the total economic loss due to worldwide climatic change.  Till now estimates of this type have not been able to give a definite figure.  In a survey of 100 estimates, the data obtained varies from 10 American dollar per ton of carbon (3 American dollar per ton of carbon dioxide) to 350 American dollar per ton of carbon (95 American dollar per ton of carbon dioxide).  Their average is 43 American dollar per ton of carbon (12 American dollar per ton of carbon dioxide).
Some astrologers have tried to predict the amount of destruction power due to environmental changes in the entire world. Till now nobody has been able to confirm the exact value. According to an estimation of 100 predictions till now figures of American Dollar per ton carbon - 10(TC)(American Dollar per ton carbonDioxide-3) American Dollar 350/TC(95 American Dollar per ton carbon Dioxide). From this a total of 43 American Dollar per ton carbon(12 American Dollar per ton carbon dioxide) is released.
Some scientists have attempted to investigate the overall global economic impact of climate change. This kind of efforts has never been attempted before with a satisfactory breakthrough and conclusive results. A survey conducted on 100 potential parameters concluded that the impact could cost between US dollar 10 to US dollar 350 tC [US dollar 3 to 95 per ton carbondioxide (tC)] with an average of US dollar 43 [US dollar 12 per ton carbondioxide (tC)].
Some economic scientist want to doubt that how many water air changes in all over world and how much shythi happen.

After industrial revolution there is a certain increase in human activity which resulted in the increase in green house gases and increase in radiating force CO2, methane, tropospheric ozone and nitrous oxide. In the molecular point of view, methane green house gas is more preponderant than carbon dioxide but its but its concentration is so less that its radiative force is only one fourth of that of carbon dioxide. The natural production of some gases contributes to the green house effect.
Human activity increased after the industrial revolution due to which the quantity of greenhouse gases has greatly increased, as a result radiative forcing CO2, methane, tropospheric ozone, CFCs and nitrous oxide have also greatly increased. At the level of the molecule, methane greenhouse gas is more potent than carbon-dioxide, but its concentration is low that its radiative forcing is one-fourth that of carbon-dioxide. Some other naturally emitted gases contribute to the greenhouse effect.

South Africa's former president Nelson Mandela is a follower of Gandhi in 2003 Gandhi statue unveiled by critics yet he's trying to stop him in Johannesburg was exposed. Bhana and Vahed the unveiling around occurring at the making of political reformer: Gandhi in South Africa, 1913-1914 is a comment. Section "Gandhi legacy for South Africa", he writes, "Gandhi of South Africa coming generations of active workers to end white max motivated. It links the legacy of Nelson Mandela that he considered it .... The work was started by Gandhi to Mandela by her finished. Brocade they keep referring to the disputes which had broken during the unveiling of the statue of Gandhi. These two approaches form the response to Gandhi, Bhana and Vahed argue "they post on their political purpose of apartheid in South Africa Gandhi right to want to linger. They ignore the many elements about them in due Some do not help much, and what they call them a racist just as many are guilty of misrepresentation / distortion are equally guilty.
The Former President of South Africa, Nelson Mandela, is a folower of Gandhiji.In 2003,he unveiled a statue of Gandhi in Johannsberg in spite of strong opposition by Gandhijis critics.Bhana and Wahed have described events that happened during the unveiling of the statue, in their book, The Making Of A Political Reformer:Gandhi In South Africa,1913-1914.In the Chapter, Gandhijis gift to South Africa,They write,"Gandhiji inspired active reformers in South Africa to end white superiority. This links his vies with that of Nelson Mandela.This means that what work was started by Gandhiji was ended by Nelson Mandela.They continue with descriptions of events that took place at the time of the unveiling of the statue of Gandhiji.Bhana and Wahed say,"Those people took the support of Gandhiji's views because they wanted to fulfil their desire to attain important political positions. Those views that declared them as those of a lower race and called them terrorists/revolutionaries, did not help them to better their political standing.
Earlier President of South Africa Nelson Mandela is a follower of Gandhi, in 2003 in spite of the efforts of the critics of Gandhi to prevent unvieling of his effigy, he unvieled it in Johannesburg. Bhana and Wahed made a commentary of the tumultous events of the unveiling in the writing 'the making of a political reformer: Gandhi in South Africa, 1913 - 1914'.  In the section, "Heritage of Gandhi for South Africa", they write " Gandhi inspired the active workers to free the future generations of the white rule.  This heritage merges him with Nelson Mandela .. this means that the work started by Gandhi was completed by Mandela".  They conclude by referring to these clashes arising at the time of unvieling of the statue of Gandhi.  In response to these two view points about Gandhi, Bhana and Wahed argue: those who want to quote Gandhi for their political thinking after apartheid are not helping his cause by quoting wrongly about him.   And those who call him a racist are also equally guilty of wrong judjement/ wrong depiction.
ex president  of south Africa Nelson Mandela was follower of gandhiji.He supported in Johannesburg about the gandhi ji thinking.He even wrote about gandhiji.The work which was started by gandhiji has been ended by the nelson mandela successfully.

If I was a Jew and was born in germany and there was my livelihood, so consider my home to germany. Even though a decent German Dhmkt me that he would shoot me or will throw in a blind prison. I Practices Hedic Hriepar and mother will refuse to be subjected to. Neahe Jewish brothers I'll wait to and Insce they come and Join me in my legal Prathodh. But I have confidence that finally all will be bound by my example. Here is the recipe was that one or all Jews accept Jewish, their status is today will not be worst. And given the suffering they voluntarily co-bike so he will provide the inner strength and joy. And calculated violence of Hitler's genocide of the Jews as a simple male to be extracted and the announcement of atrocities against his will first answer. To bear the suffering of the Jews voluntarily Hyar mind, my imagination that Sshar Thanksgiving Day and enjoy the day will change. As Jivoha ..... wrought by the hands of a tyrant by giving his nation. Having the fear of God not afraid of the terror of death.
If I were a Jew born in Germany, I would have been living in Germany and would have considered Germany as my mother country. Even if a fellow German would have threatened to kill me or imprison me in the darkest jail, I would never give in to accepting something which in my opinion is not right.This is why I will wait for my Jewish brothers to join me in my stand against the wrongful things.I am, in fact, confident that everyone will regard me as a model, and follow my actions.If one or all Jews accept the method stated here,their living conditions will not deteriorate more than they have till now.If they succeed in tolerating the pain given to them, they will attain internal power and happiness. This will be the first revolt against the actions of Hitler, who has indulged in manslaughter and planned violence.If the minds of the Jews learn to tolerate pain voluntarily, the day of death will also transform into a Thanksgiving Day or a joyous day.Just like Jihova gave his whole tribe in the hands of a tyrant. One who fears God does not feel the fear of death.
  If I were a Jew and born in Germany and was earning my livelihood there itself I would consider Germany as my home in spite of some German citizen threatening me that he would shoot me and kill me or throw me in a dark dungeon, I will refuse to become subservient to insecular and fugitive practices.  And I will not anticipate my Jewish brothers to come and restore my costitutional citizenship, but I will be self confident that in the end all will be bound to emulate my example.  If even one or all Jews accept the prescription given here, their condition will not be worse than what it is today, and if they emdure the torturing willingly, then it will give them internal strength and joy, and Hitler's well planned torture also will show up as a common human massacre and this will be the first answer against the annnouncement of his misdeeds.  If the mind of the Jews gets prepared to willingly endure torture, then I imagine that sad days also will convert into days of joy and memorable as if converted by Jehova .. did this by surrendering his clan into the hands of an oppressor. Those who resepect God, will not be afraid of death.
If i would have been yahudese and would have born in Germany and would have been living there for survival,then i would have considered Germany as my home country even if they would have given me the warning to kill me,to throw me in well.Every yahudese should adopt this way as it will improve their conditions.If they learn to bear the pain it would make them powerful and boost their self confidence level.Every yahudese should be ready to bear the pain.Who fear from the god they never afraid from the death.

By Nuclear weapons nebhiya ozar was checked ,especially in development starting times some times near the groups leaved .this population totally effected on their development radioactive effects on human life.
During the cold war, research into the nuclear weapons was being done, specially in the early stages of their development, sometimes near the settlement regions also.  The effect of this on population and its development is very bad, radioactivity is a serious danger to human health, the difficulties in banning it are related to nuclear power.  Though lot of caution is exercised in this field, still the magnitude of the damage caused by the incidents of Three Mile Island and Chernobyl caused a disbelief in people, considering future difficulties.  Most forms of nuclear research were banned.  Even before imposing restrictions, the limit of background radiation was increased very much.
The biological effects of internally deposited radionuclides depend greatly on the activity and the biodistribution and removal rates of the radionuclide, which in turn depends on its chemical form. The biological effects may also depend on the chemical toxicity of the deposited material, independent of its radioactivity. Some radionuclides may be generally distributed throughout the body and rapidly removed, as is the case with tritiated water. Some radionuclides may target specific organs and have much lower removal rates. For instance, the thyroid gland takes up a large percentage of any iodine that enters the body. If large quantities of radioactive iodine are inhaled or ingested, the thyroid may be impaired or destroyed, while other tissues are affected to a lesser extent. Radioactive iodine is a common fission product; it was a major component of the radiation released from the Chernobyl disaster, leading to nine fatal cases of pediatric thyroid cancer and hypothyroidism. On the other hand, radioactive iodine is used in the diagnosis and treatment of many diseases of the thyroid precisely because of the thyroid's selective uptake of iodine.
Due to use of Nuclear weapons ie testing of nucelar weapons some times its tested at places which are close to human inhabitant area. It is very harmful of human life. radioactive rays are emitted in high amount due to nuclear weapons . The insidences of Three Mile island and chernby is best examples. so most form are banned which is showign background radiation effect

For example, in Jamaica, an AT & T customers discounted international service can pay an additional 0.65 per minute while a B - Mobile (Jamaica) International Service for the same client / bin / sh.20 pay per minute have to. Some service providers are focusing on their sales. For example, Jamaica's national phone C & W (Cable & Wireless) to replace the company Wahi B - local calls on mobile customer will pay less but more on international calls. The price difference is mainly due to currency changes in the local currency is the purchase of the SIM. In the U.S., this type of competition in services does not exist because some major service provider to pay - as - you - go do not offer the service. [Pay - as - you - go Requirements References, T - Mobile rumor, Verizon one provided, AT & T 12/2008 not].
For example, in Jamaica, an AT & T customers discounted international services will have to pay anything extra for the 65 husband-minute service providers differentiate their sales while focusing on national sales regional sales Kanderia do something for example, Jamaika's national phone C & W (only and wireless) to replace the company Wahi B - mobile customers at fixed periods, but international calls will be paying more on the price difference is caused mainly because of currency Parivrthana SIM purchase is in local currency competition in such services in the U.S. do not exist because some major service providers offer the service does not get paid when you (when you go Bugtan requirements model T Mobile rumor, verizon offers a not AT & T 12/2008)
For example, in Jamaica, a AT&T customer opted for an international service. Additional payment of 65 per minute can be made, whereas a B-Mobile (Jamaica) customer has to pay for an equivalent international service /bin/sh.20 for every minute.  Some service providers focus on international sales, whereas some others on regional sales.  For example, The National Phone Company of Jamaica, Cable and Wireless (C&W) Company's position is that the same B-phone customers spend less on local calls and more on international calls.  This difference is mainly because of the currency conversion, because SIM card is purchased in local currency.  In America, there is no competition for such services because some prominent service providers do not offer settle-when-you-quit service.  [settlement-when-you-quit requirements Reference, T-Mobile Report, Offer to Verizon One, AT&T not till 12/2008]
For example, In Jamaica, A AT&T subscriber may pay an additional charge of .65 per minute, whereas a B-Mobile (Jamaica) will be charged a /bin/sh.20 per minute for international calls. Some providers base their charges on international networks that they use.For example, a person using a local C&W (cable and wireless)network linked to a B-Mobile network will need to pay extra for international calls. This charge is also based on currency rates,since Sim is bought at national rates.In the United States, the service providers are not in competition and hence are not on as-you-come-basis.

  Travel and global awareness were not very common, and so existence of common sources of pollution was not known more than the local sources. Polluted air was considered harmful to health, smoke from burning of wood and coal was harmful to future population in a limited way. Septic pollution or toxicisation of water was harmful to people who depended on it, particularly when such sources are scarce. Superstitions were very powerful and such issues were probably beyond limits.
Sampling of water for physical or chemical testing can be done by several methods, depending on the accuracy needed and the characteristics of the contaminant. Many contamination events are sharply restricted in time, most commonly in association with rain events. For this reason "grab" samples are often inadequate for fully quantifying contaminant levels. Scientists gathering this type of data often employ auto-sampler devices that pump increments of water at either time or discharge intervals.    Sampling for biological testing involves collection of plants and/or animals from the surface water body. Depending on the type of assessment, the organisms may be identified for biosurveys (population counts) and returned to the water body, or they may be dissected for bioassays to determine toxicity.
The earliest precursor of pollution generated by life forms would have been a natural function of their existence. The attendant consequences on viability and population levels fell within the sphere of natural selection. These would have included the demise of a population locally or ultimately, species extinction. Processes that were untenable would have resulted in a new balance brought about by changes and adaptations. At the extremes, for any form of life, consideration of pollution is superseded by that of survival.    For humankind, the factor of technology is a distinguishing and critical consideration, both as an enabler and an additional source of byproducts. Short of survival, human concerns include the range from quality of life to health hazards. Since science holds experimental demonstration to be definitive, modern treatment of toxicity or environmental harm involves defining a level at which an effect is observable. Common examples of fields where practical measurement is crucial include automobile emissions control, industrial exposure (e.g. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) PELs), toxicology (e.g. LD50), and medicine.
From the burn of sticks and coal smoke obtain it causes diseases this smoke is harmful to population ,drinking water also become poisonius

  This power is also subject to review by the Court but the obligation to prove the misuse of this power or malafides is on the person who is challenging it after promulgaion of ordinance ending the Parliament is also in good custom because necessity for ordinance is immediate whereas Parlianment takes time to pass any statute We can consider the ordinance a temporary legislation which is under the Constitutional powers of the President but also the Government can do it with the advice of the Council of Ministers if the parliament rejects any ordinance any time, even after its expiration the actions taken within the period of validity are not considered unconstitutional.
This power is examined by the judiciary and it should not be used for misuse.It is used when the parliament takes more than enough time given to take the decision.
This power is re-imposed by court but miss-use of this authority will be with the person who challenged it. The purpose behind the order might be of discontinuation of term, because order is required immediately while ministry is taking time for passing any ordinance. Regulations can be for infinite time that can be under purview of president. They works as per instructions of ministry council. If parliament rejects any ordinance then that become discontinued henceforth but the work done under it till time are not be void.
This power is also subject to review by the court, but the misfortune of misusing the power will rest on that person who in order to face this challenge issue the ordinance, can get the Parliament session prorogued in view of the emergency to take steps as the Parliament will take time to deliberate. Ordinance comes under the statutory powers of the President though he goes by the advice of the Union Cabinet Ministers and when if the Parliament doses not approve any Ordinance then it will be a loss, but under the rules any steps taken as per the Ordinance will not be unconstitutional.

Environmental pollution as we know it today was given birth by the industrial revolution only. Development of very big factories and use of coal and other fossil fuel on a large scale led to unforeseen air pollution and industrial chemicals were let out on a large scale, alongside level untreated human waste also rose.  Chicago and Cincinnati were the first two American cities who made statutes in 1881 for ensuring clean air. Till th beginning of 20th century, other cities of the country followed similar regulations, a small air pollution office was made under the Internal Department. In the end of 1940, Los Angeles, Donora, Pennsylvania cities faced many fog situations, which reminded people of public service.
Domestic sewage is 99.9% pure water, the other 0.1% are pollutants. While found in low concentrations, these pollutants pose risk on a large scale.[20] In urban areas, domestic sewage is typically treated by centralized sewage treatment plants. In the U.S., most of these plants are operated by local government agencies, frequently referred to as publicly owned treatment works (POTW). Municipal treatment plants are designed to control conventional pollutants: BOD and suspended solids. Well-designed and operated systems (i.e., secondary treatment or better) can remove 90 percent or more of these pollutants
It was the industrial revolution that gave birth to environmental pollution as we know it today. The emergence of great factories and consumption of immense quantities of coal and other fossil fuels gave rise to unprecedented air pollution and the large volume of industrial chemical discharges added to the growing load of untreated human waste. Chicago and Cincinnati were the first two American cities to enact laws ensuring cleaner air in 1881. Other cities followed around the country until early in the 20th century, when the short lived Office of Air Pollution was created under the Department of the Interior. Extreme smog events were experienced by the cities of Los Angeles and Donora, Pennsylvania in the late 1940s, serving as another public reminder.Chicago and Cincinnati were the first two American cities to enact laws ensuring cleaner air in 1881.

In United States of America, between mid 1950 and before 1970, pollution attracted people's attention a lot, when Congress passed Noise Control Act, Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, and National Environmental Policy Act.
The Clean Water Act is the primary federal law in the United States governing water pollution.[1] Commonly abbreviated as the CWA, the act established the goals of eliminating releases of high amounts of toxic substances into water, eliminating additional water pollution by 1985, and ensuring that surface waters would meet standards necessary for human sports and recreation by 1983.    The principal body of law currently in effect is based on the Federal Water Pollution Control Amendments of 1972, which significantly expanded and strengthened earlier legislation.[2] Major amendments were enacted in the Clean Water Act of 1977[3] and the Water Quality Act of 1987.[4]    The Clean Water Act does not directly address groundwater contamination. Groundwater protection provisions are included in the Safe Drinking Water Act, Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and the Superfund act.
Pollution began to draw major public attention in the United States between the mid-1950s and early 1970s, when Congress passed the Noise Control Act, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act and the National Environmental Policy Act.    Bad bouts of local pollution helped increase consciousness. PCB dumping in the Hudson River resulted in a ban by the EPA on consumption of its fish in 1974. Long-term dioxin contamination at Love Canal starting in 1947 became a national news story in 1978 and led to the Superfund legislation of 1980. Legal proceedings in the 1990s helped bring to light Chromium-6 releases in California--the champions of whose victims became famous. The pollution of industrial land gave rise to the name brownfield, a term now common in city planning. DDT was banned in most of the developed world after the publication of Rachel Carson's Silent Spring.
When congress announced act noise control act,clean act ,clean water act,national environment policy act.

The way a normal human being gets confused/upset after facing lot of troubles in his life and decides to leave this world for peace , the same way Arjun , the superhero of Mahabharta is scared of all hardships he has faced. He is depressed with the life of a warrior . Like Arjun we also, sometimes lose hope in time of crisis and turn our faces away from our responsibilities.
Just like a common man who gets entangled in his routine life and gets depressed and thereafter tries to run away from the daily chores of life Arjun who is the main hero of Mahabharat was scared of the problems to be faced in life and was disappointed from his Kshatriya religion, just like Arjun we also sometimes during our indecisiveness get depressed and do walk away from our basic duties toward life.
Just as a common man gets ruffled by the problems in his life and becomes puzzled about the course of action to be taken & tries to run away from the problem, Arjun,the hero of Mahabharat gets distressed by the problems, forgets his duties. Like Arjun, sometimes we all get caught in situation of indecisiveness, become distressed or troubled by problems, flee away from the duties.
Arjun is the chief of the army who leads the battle of Mahabharath. But he is unable to face the problems.In despair he cannot make out what to do or what not to do. In our daily life everyone like Arjun faces this problem and we deny to accomplish our duty.

Chin main force pollution is developed their are some instructions in chin
China's rapid industrialization has caused an increase Afie in Pradoshon. Some relevant laws in China: Environmental Protection Act 1979 which is based on U.S. law mandling but the environment continues to deteriorate after 12 years, only one Chinese city trying to clean their water was Aprisht indicates China, after 30 years of U.S. environmental regulation and 10 to 20 years behind Europe in July 2007 it was stated by the World Bank to know who put up a stop to the report, 790,000 people in China-related diseases Pradoshon R Rose was dying to reveal China's state environmental agency and health ministry Sarkshaon (Health Ministry) from the World Bank asked to cut premature death is calculated so that the report "social unrest" not erupt
The intense industrialization in China had increased the levels of pollution quite a bit. China has some relevant laws: The Environmental Conservation Law of 1979, which is based on a law in America but even after this the there is climatic deterioration. Only one city in China was trying to clean the water waste. This indicates that China is 30 years backwards in environmental regulations by America and 10-20 years by Europe. It was said in July 2007 that the World Bank had deliberately put a halt on this report which showed reasons for the cause of death of 750,000 people due to diseases caused by pollution. China's State and Climate Conservation Agency along with the Health Ministry had requested for a decrease in the count of premature deaths so that this report does not disturb social peace.
The environment in China has traditionally been neglected as the country concentrates on its rise as an economic power. Despite a recent interest in environmental reform, pollution has made cancer the leading cause of death in 30 cities and 78 counties, the Ministry of Health says.[1] Only 1 percent of the country’s 560 million city inhabitants (2007) breathe air deemed safe by the European Union. Chinese industry scores very poorly in energy efficiency. Chinese steel factories use one-fifth more energy per ton than the international average. Cement needs 45 percent more power, and ethylene needs 70 percent more than average, the World Bank says. A lot of the pollution in China nowadays is generated for producing the cheap products that fill stores in the United States and Europe. However, the major victim of this pollution is the Chinese population itself.

some times it continues for the second day due to bad weather or postponed for bad weather main result is to get the result not to draw the match but it becomes difficult to declare result due to high score or bad weather each team plays for an innings which is for 40 or 50 overs, twenty 20 overs are faced by each team hobart a limited overs international is said
If such matches are stopped during a day because of bad weather, they are continued the next day.The aim of a Limited overs match is to get a definite outcome. There is no possibility of a match ending in a "draw". The only possibility of a result being undeclared is when the match ends in a "tie", or the match having being stopped due to bad weather.Each team plays a single innings and faces a limited number of overs.Generally the overs are set for 40 or 50. In a 20-20 match, each team plays just for 20 overs. During the Hobart Limited Overs International Match

Each tem plays only one innings and a limited number of overs. Mostly, the limit is 40 or 50 overs. In Twenty20 cricket, each team plays only 20 overs. During Hobart limted overs International
Practically, on some occasions a match continues to the next if it gets stopped or is suspended due to bad weather conditions.

Each team plays only one innings  and faces only a limited number of overs. Commonly the limits is either 40 or 50. In Twenty20 Cricket each team faces only twenty overs.

End:For this two famous different feelings were applied.
So two main parts of them are as:
Nabhikiya knowledge development from that radioactive contamination pollution happened.which is harmful for lakhs of years.Lake Karachi which name was given by world watch institute.
  Due to the development of nuclear science, radioactive contamination happened.  This can remain harmful for hundreds of thousands of years.  Lake Karachey was named by Worldwatch Institute as "the most polluted place on earth", this place was used as a dumping place for waste and refuge by Soviet Union between 1950 and 1960.  Second place is U.S.S.R.'s Chelyabinsk, "The Most Contaminated Spot on the Planet".
Radioactive contamination is typically the result of a spill or accident during the production or use of radionuclides (radioisotopes), an unstable nucleus which has excessive energy. Contamination may occur from radioactive gases, liquids or particles. For example, if a radionuclide used in nuclear medicine is accidentally spilled, the material could be spread by people as they walk around. Radioactive contamination may also be an inevitable result of certain processes, such as the release of radioactive xenon in nuclear fuel reprocessing. In cases that radioactive material cannot be contained, it may be diluted to safe concentrations. Nuclear fallout is the distribution of radioactive contamination by a nuclear explosion. For a discussion of environmental contamination by alpha emitters please see actinides in the environment. Containment is what differentiates radioactive material from radioactive contamination. Therefore, radioactive material in sealed and designated containers is not properly referred to as contamination, although the units of measurement might be the same.
  Nuclear science causes radioactive pollution which last for thousand of years. Lake Karachay whcih is noted by worldwatch institute. Its most polluted area in world. This place is used from 1950-1960 by soviet union for dumping their waste. second place is known as planets highest polluted area which is also caused by USSR

As soon as the situation became so that Nehru was key to the political potency and future of the Congress. Nehru embraced secularism, socialist economic policies and a non-aligned foreign policy, which became the hallmark of the modern Congress Party. Nehru's policies challenged the landed class, the business class and improved the position of religious minorities and lower caste Hindus. A generation of freedom fighting leaders were soon replaced by a generation of people who had grown up in the shadow of Nehru. Nehru led the Congress Party to consecutively majorities in the later elections held.
He did not disagree with this decision of party but felt that if he resigns, his popularity with Indians will make it easy to strengthen the party membership that was till now existing with communists, socialists, trade unions, students, religious leaders, and different groups.
He was not against the election but he thought that it may help them to make their party famous among the communists, Socialist, the organizations, and religious leaders.

Visions of the persecution of Jews german no parallel in history. Old fashioned dictator ever so mad as Hitler did not happen and they do it with religious zeal that he presented a unique and war is the nation whose name no one becomes inhuman rule of humanity that just Puruskrih in the future will be. Is evident that crime was a mad but intrepid youth by all race with unbelievable ferocity will. If ever a just war in the name of humanity, a Puri com germany to the persecution of the brash, said the war can be completely reasonable. May not believe in any war. Margin of this war - the loss in my right is discussed. But like the Jews by germany's war against crime can not be not aligned with the germany. How can it be an alliance between the countries in which a justice and democracy and another claims that have been declared enemy of both?
It is felt that the German injustice towards Jews is unparalled. No ruler till date has been so evil as Hitler has been.No crimes can be justified by citing religious principles of declaring a higher race among people, which will be accepted and credited now and in the future.It is clear that insanity of a young leader cannot justify horrific crimes against an entire race.No such crimes can be said as a lawful war of Germany in the name of humanity.But I do not beleive in any kind of war.It is beyond my ability to discuss the benefit and losses of war.If we cannot confront Germany and stop it from committing such crimes, then we must stop any alliances with Germany. How is an alliance possible between two countries, one of which declares itself as a lawful, democratic state, whereas the other indulges in declaring war with the very principles of war and democracy.
It appears that in history, there is no parallel to the torture of the Jews in Germany.  No dictator of the earlier times became so mad as Hitler did and he did this with such a religious fervour that he presented a warring and unique nation on whose name any inhumanity becomes a law of humanity which will be rewarded now and in future.  The indication is that the crimes committed by a mad but fearless youth cast unbelievable anger on the entire caste. If anytime any lawful war in the name of humanity can be called just, then the all out war against the stubborn atrocities of Germans can be called just.  But I dont believe in any war.  The debate on the pros and cons of war is not in the area of my competence.  But if a war can not be fought against the crimes committed on Jews by Germany, then an alliance also can not be forged with Germany.  How is it possible that an alliance is forged between two nations, in which one promises justice and democracy and the other declares these two as enemies?
It seems Germany trouble giving to yahudese is not a new things in history.Hitler was mad than other rulers. Hitler was young mad rulers.He was very aggressive.He played polities by saying that he doesn't believe in war and made some friendship with other countries same time he made enemies too.

Noise Control Act was made to address the standards for noise level and to control the noise from transport instruments and all sources of noise like motor vehicles, aircraft, some special HVAC equipment and other popular instruments.  This made a plan for local governments to find out the effects of land use of these instruments on sound and also for noise mitigation. Under the framework of noise mitigation, as a responsibility of the local governments, it mad and expanded a data base of the health effects of noiseto a practically useful level
The Noise Pollution and Abatement Act of 1972 is a statute of the United States initiating a federal program of regulating noise pollution with the intent of protecting human health and minimizing annoyance of noise to the general public.[1]    The Act established mechanisms of setting emission standards for virtually every source of noise, including motor vehicles, aircraft, certain types of heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) equipment and major appliances. It also put local governments on notice as to their responsibilities in land use planning to address noise mitigation. This noise regulation framework comprised a broad data base detailing the extent of noise health effects.
There are a variety of strategies for mitigating roadway noise including: use of noise barriers, limitation of vehicle speeds, alteration of roadway surface texture, limitation of heavy vehicles, use of traffic controls that smooth vehicle flow to reduce braking and acceleration, and tire design. An important factor in applying these strategies is a computer model for roadway noise, that is capable of addressing local topography, meteorology, traffic operations and hypothetical mitigation. Costs of building-in mitigation can be modest, provided these solutions are sought in the planning stage of a roadway project.    Aircraft noise can be reduced to some extent by design of quieter jet engines, which was pursued vigorously in the 1970s and 1980s. This strategy has brought limited but noticeable reduction of urban sound levels. Reconsideration of operations, such as altering flight paths and time of day runway use, has demonstrated benefits for residential populations near airports. FAA sponsored residential retrofit (insulation) programs initiated in the 1970s has also enjoyed success in reducing interior residential noise in thousands of residences across the United States.

This is similar to horse riding position.Here women get more support from men while doing the act.She fold the leg and directly sits on the penis of the men.here women can get support from men,men can hold women waist while having sex.man should force and support women to make this position better as women jumps straight on the tip of penis to insert her vagina directly.
This position is very similar to the horse-rider position. It differs just a little from the horse-rider position. In this the woman gets a little more support from the man. In the horse-rider position coitus supported by the knees on legs spread parallel to the bed appears a little stable, but for young and energetic people this has been changed a little and the Asian horse-rider position has been created. In this the woman makes her legs lengthwise of the bed and brings the vagina over the penis by bending at the knees. To attain this position the man should lie straight on his back and the woman should stand with her feet next to his buttocks. Then she should try to sit by bending at the knees. At the end the Asian horse-rider position will be attained. Though the woman requires more effort during coitus in this position, but the man can make this position spectacular by supporting the woman's buttocks with his hands.
This is approximately the same position as the horse riding position.  With a small difference this is separated from the horse riding position.  In this the woman gets some more support from the man.  In the horse riding position, on the legs spread parallel to the cot, intercourse with the strength of the knees looks stable, but for young and active persons, a small modification is made and Asian horse riding position is made.  In this the lady keeps her legs perpendicular to the cot and folding her knees brings her cunt right above the phallus.  To get into this position, man lies down on his back and the woman connects her feet with his pelvis and stands up and then from the knees turning her legs tries to sit down, by this Asian horse riding position is made.  However in this position the effort of the lady in intercourse is more but the man can give support to the pelvis of the lady with his hands and can make this position splendid.
this is very closely related to horse riding position  its little differnt from horse riding here women gets more sport than gents in horseriding way

These models are based on the theories of transportation of fluids, radiative transfer and other processes, rough borders are smoothened as the computers have their own limits, and systems of climatic planning are complex.  All modern climate models take an environmental model in them and this depends on the models of the sea and ice on earth and on the sea.  In some models, effect of chemical and biological processes is also considered.  In these models it comes to light that if the effect of the greenhouse gases is considered, it results in a warm climate.  Even so, the assumption is made that climate sensitivity has a big role.
These models are based on, physics principles of liquid movement, radiative transfer and other process. In some places it is simplified, because computer has its limitations, and climate system has vary complexity. All modern climate models has environmental models in it. It get separate from ocean model or soil and models of ice on ocean. Some model have included the treatment of chemical and biological processes. These models measure effect of green house gases and we get worm climate adding these effects. Then also, when using these assumption there is big role of climate sensitivity.
These models are based on basic principals, radiative transfer and other processes. Computer has its own limits and air-water patterns are very complex in nature. All modern air-water models consist of one more model which is adjoined with the model on oceans and land. Some models have chemical and biological processes contained within. These models find out if the effect of green houses gases are added together then what will be the effect on climate. Climate sensitivity also has a very important role in this.
These models study the transformations in materials, their radiative transfer, and state the facts in a comprehensive and easy way.The reason is that the capabilities of a computer are limited and the measurements are complex.There are different models like the environmental model, the oceanic model, the ice models(that on earth and on water i.e. icebergs) and all these models are linked together. Some models are also used for studying the chemical and biological changes and see the effect of emission of greenhouse gases on them. Climate sensitivity of different factors is studied and measured.

This seems that Quran was descended especially for Arabian but whenever you reach to the place where one can feel as if this sentence is especially for special time or country, then stay for a while and think or note the things and then you think about it then you will realise that people from all decade and from every land place is same and on them same thing is applicable which was applicable to Arabian from that time.
Apparently it feels that the Quran has been created for the Arabs of that time only, but whenever you reach a place where it is felt that these words were meant for a particular time or a particular country, if you stop there to ponder over it or take a note and later on deliberate on it, you will feel that human beings of all the time and of all the places are all alike and for them these words are equally applicable as they were for the Arabs of that time.
Overall, it can be understood that the Quran originated for the ancient Arabs for a certain period of time, but if we ever think of the Quran being only for a particular era or country, we will realise that man is universal everywhere and need the principles of the Quran as much as the ancient Arabs did.
By common sense you may think that that compassion was only for those Arabs who lived in that country then at that special particular point of time, but if you think with a sober mind you will find out that what those Arabs experience then is applicable to any human being living at any place on this earth and living in any particular point of time and further you will have the same experience those Arabs had then.

The idea of adding text messaging to the services of mobile users was latent in many communities of mobile communication services at the beginning of the 1980s. The first action plan of the CEPT Group GSM, approved in December 1982, requested "The services and facilities offered in the public switched telephone networks and public data networks... should be available in the mobile system".[4] This target includes the exchange of text messages either directly between mobile stations, or transmitted via Message Handling Systems widely in use since the beginning of the 1980s.[5]    The SMS concept was developed in the Franco-German GSM cooperation in 1984 by Friedhelm Hillebrand and Bernard Ghillebaert.[6] The innovation in SMS is Short. The GSM is optimized for telephony, since this was identified as its main application. The key idea for SMS was to use this telephony-optimized system, and to transport messages on the signaling paths needed to control the telephony traffic during time periods when no signaling traffic existed. In this way, unused resources in the system could be used to transport messages at minimal cost. However, it was necessary to limit the length of the messages to 128 bytes (later improved to 140 bytes, or 160 seven-bit characters) so that the messages could fit into the existing signaling formats.    This concept allowed SMS to be implemented in every mobile station by updating its software. This concept was instrumental for the implementation of SMS in every mobile station ever produced and in every network from early days. Hence, a large base of SMS capable terminals and networks existed when the users began to utilize the SMS.[7] A new network element required was a specialized short message service center, and enhancements were required to the radio capacity and network transport infrastructure to accommodate growing SMS traffic.
Short Message Service (SMS) is the text communication service component of phone, web or mobile communication systems, using standardized communications protocols that allow the exchange of short text messages between fixed line or mobile phone devices. SMS text messaging is the most widely used data application in the world, with 2.4 billion active users, or 74% of all mobile phone subscribers.[citation needed] The term SMS is used as a synonym for all types of short text messaging as well as the user activity itself in many parts of the world.    SMS as used on modern handsets was originated from radio telegraphy in radio memo pagers using standardized phone protocols and later defined as part of the Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) series of standards in 1985[1] as a means of sending messages of up to 160 characters[2], to and from GSM mobile handsets.[3] Since then, support for the service has expanded to include other mobile technologies such as ANSI CDMA networks and Digital AMPS, as well as satellite and landline networks.[citation needed] Most SMS messages are mobile-to-mobile text messages though the standard supports other types of broadcast messaging as well.

In 1598, a court case filed in 1550's by students of Royal Grammar School, Guildford enlighten. This is oldest case of this game. This seems that it was children game but around 1610, adult started to play this game and just after that Inter perish village Cricket played. In 1624, one of the player-Jasper Vinall dead during match between two teams in susex of perish, he had head injury.
A number of other words have been suggested as sources for the term "cricket". In the earliest definite reference to the sport in 1598,[9] it is called creckett. Given the strong medieval trade connections between south-east England and the County of Flanders when the latter belonged to the Duchy of Burgundy, the name may have been derived from the Middle Dutch[10] krick(-e), meaning a stick (crook); or the Old English cricc or cryce meaning a crutch or staff.[11] In Old French, the word criquet seems to have meant a kind of club or stick.[12] In Samuel Johnson's Dictionary, he derived cricket from "cryce, Saxon, a stick".[13] Another possible source is the Middle Dutch word krickstoel, meaning a long low stool used for kneeling in church and which resembled the long low wicket with two stumps used in early cricket.[14] According to Heiner Gillmeister, a European language expert of Bonn University, "cricket" derives from the Middle Dutch phrase for hockey, met de (krik ket)sen (i.e., "with the stick chase").[15] Dr Gillmeister believes that not only the name but the sport itself is of Flemish origin.[16]
Despite many prior suggested references, the first definite reference to the game is found in a 1598 court case concerning dispute over a school's ownership of a plot of land. A 59-year old coroner, John Derrick, testified that he and his school friends had played creckett on the site fifty years earlier. The school was the Royal Grammar School, Guildford, and Mr Derrick's account proves beyond reasonable doubt that the game was being played in Surrey c.1550.[5]    The first reference to it being played as an adult sport was in 1611, when two men in Sussex were prosecuted for playing cricket on Sunday instead of going to church.[6] In the same year, a dictionary defines cricket as a boys' game and this suggests that adult participation was a recent development.
Gambling introduced the first patrons because some of the gamblers decided to strengthen their bets by forming their own teams and it is believed the first "county teams" were formed in the aftermath of the Restoration in 1660, especially as members of the nobility were employing "local experts" from village cricket as the earliest professionals.[5] The first known game in which the teams use county names is in 1709 but there can be little doubt that these sort of fixtures were being arranged long before that. The match in 1697 was probably Sussex versus another county.    The most notable of the early patrons were a group of aristocrats and businessmen who were active from about 1725, which is the time that press coverage became more regular, perhaps as a result of the patrons' influence. These men included the 2nd Duke of Richmond, Sir William Gage, Alan Brodrick and Edward Stead. For the first time, the press mentions individual players like Thomas Waymark.
In Mahabharat, there is a story which says that when Gods kept all the four Vedas in one pan of a balance and Bharat epic in the other, Bharat weighed more than the four Vedas together.  Seeing this greatness of the epic "Bharat", Gods and saints named it "Mahabharat", and because of this story, among humans also, it became popular with the name "Mahabharat".
There is a story in Mahabharat which says that the Devas placed all the four Vedas on one side of the balance and kept Mahabharat book on the other, the side with Mahabharat weighed heavier than the other; because of this high magnitude (Mahan) of value, the Devas and saints who saw this wonder named the epic "Mahabharat".  Again, because of this story, the book became popular by the name "Mahabharat"  among common people also.
A story in the Mahabharata states that once upon a time, when the four Holy Vedas were weighed using a weighing scale against the "Epic Poem Bharata" by the gods, the "Bharata epic" outweighed the four Holy Vedas, therefore, having seen the greatness of this epic poem, the Gods and the sages named this book the Mahabharata and so even among the humans this epic poem became popularly known as the Mahabharata.
In the Mahabharata, a story comes when the gods of the scale variables in a dice "Vedas" and placed second at the "Indian texts" to put the "treatise of India" has proved to be full of all the scriptures than most, so "India treatise "The greatness of the gods and saints by looking at the" Mahabharata "named in the story of the men caused the poetic" Mahabharata "was the name of the most famous.
