The All India Muslim League (AIML) was formed in Dhaka in 1906 by Muslims who were suspicious of the Hindu-majority Indian National Congress. They complained that Muslim members did not have the same rights as Hindu members. A number of different scenarios were proposed at various times. Among the first to make the demand for a separate state was the writer/philosopher Allama Iqbal, who, in his presidential address to the 1930 convention of the Muslim League said that a separate nation for Muslims was essential in an otherwise Hindu-dominated subcontinent.    The Sindh Assembly passed a resolution making it a demand in 1935. Iqbal, Jouhar and others then worked hard to draft Mohammad Ali Jinnah, who had till then worked for Hindu-Muslim unity, to lead the movement for this new nation. By 1930, Jinnah had begun to despair of the fate of minority communities in a united India and had begun to argue that mainstream parties such as the Congress, of which he was once a member, were insensitive to Muslim interests.

We cannot appreciate the classical music unless we make an attempt to listen to it and understand its intricacies and imaginative beauty.  Some what like this is the situation when the man is on top.  Here now time has come to make the classic position as civil and systemic, and investigate into the reasons for its being classic.  Along with this, I want to make it clear that when the man is on top, the aim should not at all be seen as the woman experiences a negative forceful relationship.  Nor it can be called as a boring position of the old times, just as some people nowadays think about positions with the man on top.  We can make some modifications in this position and make it a position which gives great experience.  In all these positions, the responsibility for thrusts is on the man.  For any fundamental position, a bit of talking to each other at the start is very effective.  If there is communication gap, any position is not as enjoyable to either of them as they imagine.  In fact every woman wants to see her man in such a shape and mould that he can be goaded to the extreme end of the pleasures of sex.  For this the requirement is choice of a good position, which they can discuss and gels with their imagined shape.  This effort is a great stimulant for a magnificient arousal.  If they are once successful in doing this, they can focus on their favourite spot and take great pleasure of the ride.  Here it is also necessary to mention that most men choose the position with them on the top because they can reach the height of excitement.  As such, a natural advantage of this position is that by men being on top, it is powerful position.  But in this position if the man goes with high speed and closeness from the beginning, they will definitely become weak and lose excitement during the last stages of sex, because they cannot be in control of the rhythm of sex.  This position is very good for people who are new entrants, but when it can be used imaginatively, it is very enjoyable for all classes.  Therefore it is necessary that the woman tells the man that he be in contrlo and experiment and see in which modification they get more pleasure.
