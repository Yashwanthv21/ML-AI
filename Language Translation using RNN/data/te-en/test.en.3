Information Technology
he OS/2 file system HPFS contained several important new features. When Microsoft created their new operating system, they borrowed many of these concepts for NTFS.[6] Probably as a result of this common ancestry, HPFS and NTFS share the same disk partition identification type code (07). Sharing an ID is unusual since there were dozens of available codes, and other major file systems have their own code. FAT has more than nine (one each for FAT12, FAT16, FAT32, etc.). Algorithms which identify the file system in a partition type 07 must perform additional checks. It is also clear that NTFS owes some of its architectural design to Files-11 used by VMS. This is hardly surprising since Dave Cutler was the main lead for both VMS and Windows NT.

In the mid 1980s, Microsoft and IBM formed a joint project to create the next generation of graphical operating system. The result of the project was OS/2, but Microsoft and IBM disagreed on many important issues and eventually separated. OS/2 remained an IBM project. Microsoft started[citation needed] to work on Windows NT. The OS/2 file system HPFS contained several important new features. When Microsoft created their new operating system, they borrowed many of these concepts for NTFS.[6] Probably as a result of this common ancestry, HPFS and NTFS share the same disk partition identification type code (07). Sharing an ID is unusual since there were dozens of available codes, and other major file systems have their own code. FAT has more than nine (one each for FAT12, FAT16, FAT32, etc.). Algorithms which identify the file system in a partition type 07 must perform additional checks. It is also clear that NTFS owes some of its architectural design to Files-11 used by VMS. This is hardly surprising since Dave Cutler was the main lead for both VMS and Windows NT.
