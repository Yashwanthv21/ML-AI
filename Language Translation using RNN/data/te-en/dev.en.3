mahabharat
Vera is released from prison in the season première and seeks to foil her estranged husband, Stephanos Doukas, by pretending to have developed a life-threatening cancer leaving her about 6 months to live. She fabricates this story with the help of Antigone and Alexandros, who help her to deceive the entire family by paying a fraudulent doctor to lie about her diagnosis. When the doctor's office disappears the truth is uncovered and uncovers Vera's sadistic plot. She is ostracised by the entire family and commits suicide as a final demonstration. Antigoni, blames her parents Mirto and Stefanos for never accepting Vera into the family, driving her to commit suicide, and leaves Greece and the Doukas family permanently venturing off to London. Her new flame, Philipos, tracks her down in France, where they become united, and he too disappears from the show. However, Antigoni was reintroduced into the show at the end of the second season, having finally gotten over Vera's death and regretting abandoning her family due to her grief. However, it was later seen that the only reason that Antigoni returned was so that she could destroy Alexandros' relationship with newcomer Tania, succeeding temporarily, but the couple later reunited after Antigoni left the country, and Nadia convinced the couple to reunite. Antigoni will probably never return to the show, as her father, disgusted in his daughter's behaviour disinherits her and places the painting of her as a small child back on his wall after she left, because that is the only way that he wants to remember her, after everything that she has done, therefore finally bringing closure to this storyline.
